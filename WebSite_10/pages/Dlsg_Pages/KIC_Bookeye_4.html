                <h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0108">Study, Report, Research, Collaborate ... Digitally</h1>

                <p class="block_text" id="BE4-0109">KIC Bookeye 4 is an indispensable tool for research, study and production of enhanced quality reports and papers with crystal clear color and black &amp; white excerpts from books, magazines and very large journals. In addition, as a UDSA compliant digitize-on-demand system conveniently located among the stacks, KIC can be used as an ad hoc digitization station by Interlibrary Loan departments.</p>

                <p class="block_text" id="BE4-0110">With its 600 dpi option, KIC Bookeye 4 sytems are perfect as shared resources, capturing the finest details for digital archival and preservation.</p>

                <p class="block_text" id="BE4-0111">The KIC Bookeye 4 can capture 20 book pages per minute for instant access on tablets, notebooks, smart devices and easy transfer to desktop PCs and servers. With a bed size more than 40% larger than its nearest competitor, Bookeye 4 is also the only high resolution scanner in the world that supports both v-cradle and flat modes, and can scan material as large as 24 x 17 inches.</p>

                <p class="block_text" id="BE4-0112">Photocopiers, fax machines, PCs, monitors and keyboards clutter up otherwise beautiful libraries across America. KIC Bookeye.4 reverses that trend, replacing copiers and fax machines and adding scanning in a single machine with clean lines and efficient design.

                <h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0201">KIC Serves Over Half of Students at Universities in America</h1>

                <p class="block_text" id="BE4-0202">In the U.S. alone, KIC serves over four million students at the top "brick and mortar" (non-online) colleges and universities. With the introduction of the KIC BookEdge, KIC Click, and KIC Click Mini, KIC is now affordable for virtually all institutions of higher learning and full-service public libraries. Last decade, libraries typically 'added' several KICs, but since 2010 libraries have begun to replace their entire patron-use copier fleets with self-serve book scanning systems.</p>

                <h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0203">A True Digital Age Multifunction System for Academic &amp; Public Libraries</h1>
                <h2 id="BE4-0204">Book Scanning</h2>

                <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0205">Students at academic libraries want speed, and DLSG offers the fastest book scanners on the market. Patrons at public libraries need simplicity, and KIC provides three of the simplest possible user interfaces, one exclusively for scanning, one exclusively for copying and one exclusively for faxing. And KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.</p>

                <h2 id="BE4-0206">Copier Replacement</h2>
                <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0207">While multifunction copiers are partly digital, they are big mechanical machines with big</p>

                <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0208">
                    maintenance issues and tiny touch screens. As a copier replacement, KIC eliminates copier failure/service problems and provides very large touch screens and view screens that are larger still. Organizing (collating, clipping, rotating, etc.) pages on a huge touch screen is much easier than shuffling paper.</p>

                <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0209">The digital age has steadily driven down the demand in libraries for paper copies to levels that make it increasingly difficult to justify copiers. KIC self-service scanning systems reduce copier use further - to the point that attaching a small laser or ink jet printer is sufficient. KIC</p>

                <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0210">systems also handle much larger materials than copiers, and they scan books without damaging them. However, the most compelling benefit of KIC over copiers is KIC's speed, due mainly to its face-up scanning design, which is not only significantly faster, but far easier to use.</p>

                <h2 id="BE4-0211">Self-Serve Fax</h2>
                <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0212">KIC's huge touch screen and larger view screen make faxing extra easy. Users can compose, review, clip, crop and change brightness and contrast of the pages of a fax before sending. KIC's step-by-step process is designed for easy operation by even the most timid users. All you need is an internet connection, and DLSG will provide the rest at a cost so low that fax revenue can pay for the KIC system in a few years or less.</p>

                <h2 id="BE4-0213">KIC Coins</h2>
                <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0214">Printing copies and faxing have per page costs that normally must be passed on to the user. KIC has a free, built-in method of charging users for copies and faxes.</p>
                <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0215">Simply print wallet-size "KIC Coins" on regular letter-sized paper in any denomination that you like, cut them out, and sell them to users at the circulation desk or wherever you collect fees for late book returns.</p>

                <h2 id="BE4-0216">KIC Compatible with Copy Card &amp; Cash Systems</h2>
                <p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0217">All KIC systems are compatible with all standard copy card and coin-op devices. Since KIC transfers images to users' computers electronically, costly expendables are avoided, even for color! The library can opt to keep all revenue it collects.</p>

                <p class="block_text8" id="BE4-0503">KIC Bookeye 4 walk-up scanning stations are face-up scanners that save a lot of time and reduce book spine damage because they capture two face-up pages of a book with each scan and do not require the user to flip the book twice for each page. KIC analyzes each image, and automatically splits it into two separate images. In addition, black edges are automatically removed and the content is straightened, producing clean, professional looking images - important for electronic reserves, course curriculum materials and research reports. These automatic image treatment functions also save a lot of faculty, administrator, and student time.</p>

                <p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0704">Ease-of-use is a central feature of KIC. Its large, 22 inch touch screen and its large "Scan" and "Save, Send or Print" buttons that occupy a very large portion of the touch screen clearly convey how easy KIC is to use. The Save button defaults to an output method and file format that is selectable by the institution. If a flash drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it will save to the flash drive. Users can override the default output method by manually selecting one or more other methods of output.

                <p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0705">KIC Bookeye 4's high speed is derived as much from its ultra-simple, true two-touch interface as from its face-up design that obviates the need to flip books over and over again during the capture process.</p>

                <p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0706">The tabletop model KIC Bookeye 4 has all the True2Touch capabilities of the full-size KIC. It has its own tabletop version of the SmartDock, and of course, an ADF scanner can be placed anywhere on the table. ADA compliance is achieved by purchasing a table with a 30 inch clearance to the floor and a 31 inch height.</p>

                <p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0707">KIC Bookeye 4's elegant design puts the full KIC self-serve digitization functionality into a compact and appealing space. Its 17" touch screen and large preview screen and capture surface are at the perfect height for wheelchair access. The KIC Bookeye 4 also offers an optional desktop configuration with a single 22" touch/preview display</p>

                    <li>KIC is very agile, and allows the user to jump from just about anywhere in the touch screen system to just about anywhere else, directly and usually with a single touch. This modern, 'modeless' design is easier to use, but difficult to create.</li>
                    <li>KIC's large buttons and controls are easy to use, even for people with unsteady hands.</li>
                    <li>KIC gradually expands and contracts controls such as brightness, con- trast and DPI so users can easliy follow their screen activity.</li>
                    <li>KIC doesn't delete original images when you clip a photo or excerpt of text unless you tell it to.</li>
                    <li>KIC lets you output to many different destinations in a single session.</li>
                    <li>Once you've scanned a document, you can change your mind as to where you would like it to output. For example, you may have wanted to save to USB, but learned your USB drive is full. Or you may scan so much that it exceeds your email limit.

                </ul>

                <h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0713">Two Large Screens for Simplicity &amp; Power</h1>

                <p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0714">It's easy to undervalue screen size. For 20 years, all cellphone makers relent- lessly pursued smaller and smaller screens until very recently when one com- pany reversed that trend. They realized that people want the largest screen that will fit in their pocket/purse and hand. This is because display screens are our window to the digital world, and touch screens give us control over that world.</p>

                <p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0715">As big as self-serve scanning systems are, it makes sense to have a very large touch screen. And with the low prices for high quality displays, it is compelling to add a separate display screen. In 2002, DLSG realized this, when the first KIC system was designed. Today, with nearly 10 years more experience than any other vendor, DLSG has the most understandable, easy to use and powerful user interface for self-serve book scanning, and it's based on dual screens.</p>

                <p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0716">The view screen shows very large, clear images of what you've scanned, allow- ing the touch screen to have big, easy to understand buttons and other controls.</p>

                <p class="block_text17" id="BE4-0717">Display screens are our portals into the digital world, and touch screens are the easiest way to control that world. That's why DLSG provides large, 24 inch, full HD displays and equally large touch screens with most of its KIC systems.</p>

                <h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0801">KIC Bookeye vs. Copiers - How KIC Compares</h1>
                <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0802">Copiers are Outmoded</h2>

                <p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0803">Since the first KIC was delivered to an academic library in 2004, the days of photocopiers for patron use in academic libraries and even public libraries were numbered. And now with the rapid explosion of tablet computers and electronic readers, the demand in academic libraries for electronic copies has substantially outstripped the de- mand for printed copies. The demand for electronic copies in public libraries is also reaching a tipping point.</p>

                <p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0804">The ability to capture virtually unlimited numbers of pages of re- search into a tablet or electronic reader and search through that ma- terial on the Internet with a tablet, eReader or notebook PC that can be used just about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely valuable. In this digital age, academic libraries are compelled to go hybrid for three reasons: 1) the high demand for digital content; 2) their existing print collections contain vast amounts of information that cannot be found on the Internet; and 3) students are receptive to the price of electronic copies - typically free.</p>

                <p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0805">So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo copiers? There are three main factors that keep the cost of photo- copies high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner and ink; 2) photo-</p>

                <p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0806">copiers require a lot of maintenance due to the number of moving parts; and 3) all major photocopier brands use a distributed service model.</p>

                <p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0807">In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC because KIC has split the scan/copy functions into three separate machines, choosing the best of breed for each. As a result, KIC offers the best book scanners by themselves or with a loose-leaf paper (ADF) scanner. Virtually any off-the-shelf laser or inkjet printer can be added to any KIC system, so you can optimize costs and speeds, and offer affordable color.</p>

                <p id="BE4-0808">ADF attachment scans
                    <br> 40 loose-leaf pages/min
                    <br> (20 sheets per minute)</p>

                <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0809">KIC Bookeye 4 Scanners vs. Copiers</h2>

                <p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0810">This graph compares the total costs of one color KIC Bookeye 4 system with three color copiers and with three black and white copiers. Both copiers are the kinds typically seen in academic libraries. One KIC Bookeye 4 is compared with three copiers because its face-up operation yields well over two times the perfor-</p>

                <p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0811">mance of a typical copier. The costs are broken into three main areas: equipment and maintenance, consumables, and patron usage time. With KIC, electronic output is assumed to be preferred over print 90% of the time. That ratio has ranged from 75-95% electronic in 2012, but is certain to rise in the future.</p>

                <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0812">No More Book Spine Damage!</h2>

                <p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0813">Thick books with stiff spines and content that runs deep into the bookfold are often damaged when copied. KIC Bookeye 4 easily captures content without damaging book spines.</p>

                <p class="block_text20" id="BE4-0814">KIC automatically removes black
                    <br> edges, straightens content,
                    <br> and produces clean, pro-
                    <br> fessional looking images
                    <br> - important for elec-
                    <br> tronic reserves, course
                    <br> curriculum materials
                    <br> and research reports.
                    <br> These automatic image
                    <br> treatment functions also
                    <br> save a lot of administrator,
                    <br> faculty, and student time.</p>

                <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0815">Thick Books...No Problem</h2>

                <p class="block_text21" id="BE4-0816">KIC Bookeye 4 handles thick books beautifully. Its contour-
                    <br>finding laser allows it to flatten even the most curved books
                    <br> and produce text that is clear and undistorted. KIC automati-
                    <br>cally adds margins for print-ready image quality.</p>

                <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0817">KIC Bookeye Scans 3 Times Faster</h2>

                <p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0818">Statistics from five million scanning sessions across America revealed a median session length of 23 pages. So, most of the time spent during a KIC session is spent scanning. Face up scanning has been proven to be three times faster than face down scanning.</p>

                <p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0819">So why is speed so important?</p>

                <ul class="peppermint" id="BE4-0820">
                    <li>It's economical. One KIC Bookeye can replace multiple copiers or other face-down scanning machines.</li>
                    <li>It gives patrons another reason to visit your library.</li>
                    <li>It's green. The faster it is, the more use it will get and the less the copier will be used.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="block_text22" id="BE4-0821">In the digital world, there is no paper, toner or ink, so libraries rarely charge for images, whether black and white or color.</p>

                <p class="block_text22" id="BE4-0822">Over the years, many libraries experimented with color copiers, but could never find a formula that worked. If the fees were low, patrons would copy materials with so much color that the library would spend more on ink than the fees they were collecting. If the fees were too high, the usage would be so low that the cost of the machine couldn't be justified.</p>

                <p class="block_text22" id="BE4-0823">KIC calculates the amount of color in an image before it is printed. So the fee for copies with a little bit of color can be the same as the fee for black and white copies. If a copy has a lot of color, the fee can be increased in proportion to the cost of the color ink or toner. This wonderful feature should be a simple, easy byproduct of the digital age, and it is with KIC.</p>

                <h3 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0902">Faster is also Easier</h3>

                <p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0903">Face-up book scanning is far easier on both patrons and books and quite a bit faster than face-down scanning.</p>

                <p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0904">Scanning books face-up makes it much easier to keep track of what pages you've scanned. With KIC Bookeye 4 and other face-up scanners, books stay face up, so you can see what you're scanning as you scan it. This extra visibility elim- inates the age old problem of skipping pages and scanning pages out of order which can occur with face-down scanners.</p>

                <p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0905">The following photo sequences show the reason that facedown scanning systems are typically 1/3 the speed of faceup systems. The book flipping necessary to scan a book on a face-down scanner like the KIC BookEdge is shown in the photo sequence below. It's a workout both for the book and the patron.</p>

                <p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0906">The ergonomic design of the face-up scanning sytems involves only the basic movement required to set a book down and turn a page.</p>

                <p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0919">Control,update and monitor your KIC systems remotely. To better serve your patrons, it is important to know which KIC systems are used the most and at what times during the day and week, and which are used the least. All usage statistics can help you to determine the best KIC configuration for each site. And to make it easier to navigate from KIC to KIC system, KIC Fleet Manager allows you to select a particular KIC system via either of two methods: a map or a list.</p>

                <p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0920">With over ten years serving libraries, KIC is the most stable product available today. However, DLSG engineers inces- santly work to improve KIC and support the growing changing digital world. DLSG offers improved software re-</p>

                <p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0921">gularly, and in order to make it easier to deploy updates, KIC Fleet Manager lets you update KIC systems remotely. For example, a recently released feature lets you turn KIC systems on and off on demand or on a schedule set by a central control panel.</p>

                <h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-1001">The Hybrid Library</h1>

                <p class="block_text25" id="BE4-1002">To fully earn the 'hybrid library' designation, a library's existing print collections must be available in digital format. KIC systems allow your students and faculty to select material for quick and easy self-serve digiti- zation, providing a valuable conduit between your print collections and patron tablets, PCs, eReaders and smart devices.</p>

                <p class="block_text25" id="BE4-1003">KIC's self-serve digitize-on-demand capabilities leverage your library's most valuable assets - its print collections.</p>

                <p class="block_text25" id="BE4-1004">Digital images don't have the limitations of physical copies. They can instantly be shared with fellow researchers around the world via email or Cloud, dramatically facilitating collaboration.</p>

                <p class="block_text25" id="BE4-1005">KIC avoids the digital rights management conundrum. Each digitization is for a single use, but thousands of patrons can digi- tize content from the same book, yet preserve the book's spine.</p>

                <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-1006">Resource Sharing</h2>

                <p class="block_text26" id="BE4-1007">We know the importance of resource sharing. To help squeeze more value out of your investment, KIC can be configured to support the BSCAN Interlibrary Loan system, the Opus Digitiza- tion Workflow system, and general ad hoc scanning.</p>

                <p class="block_text26" id="BE4-1008">Use a USB flash drive to enable other types of scanning at a KIC station and temporarily access shared folders on a network. When you unplug the USB, the KIC station automatically returns to its regular self-serve scanning station functionality.</p>

                <p class="block_text26" id="BE4-1009">For general purpose scanning by ad- ministrators and faculty, simply write a department password file to a flash drive. When a user plugs in the USB 'key', KIC recognizes the password and allows the user to save scanned images to shared folders.</p>

                <h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-1010">Premium Maintenance Plan</h2>

                <p class="block_text26" id="BE4-1011">Image Access has an unmatched service and support record. It is impossible to affordably provide service personnel living in every city and town across America that are highly trained on the very special technologies needed by libraries. Instead, DLSG designs remote serviceability into its products and has perfected remote diagnosis and when possible, repair.</p>

                <p class="block_text26" id="BE4-1012">The resulting savings allows DLSG to frequently and promptly provide loaner/swap-out equipment and to go on site whenever necessary to maintain and repair equipment, minimizing interruptions in service for your patrons.</p>

                                    With the latest member of the Bookeye family, Image Access placed an emphasis on developing a scanner which is compact, easy to operate and competitively priced; to bring high end professional scanning to an even larger population of users. The efficient Bookeye 4 digitizes source material such as bound documents at high speeds in up to 600 dpi optical resolution and formats up to DIN A2.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Over 17 years of electronic, optical and mechanical engineering experience went into the creation and manufacture of the Bookeye 4. The clever mirror mechanism captures the document precisely from edge to edge, whether it is a flat document or a book open at an angle of 120 degrees.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The V-shaped book cradle was optimized to reduce the risk of damage to book spines and binding during digitization. The book cradle holds the open book at an angle of 120 degrees; enough to effectively scan the contents of a page, while gently preserving the original subject matter.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    Bookeye 4 has all the advantages of a more expensive standalone device. Outfitted with an integrated color touchscreen and monitor, Bookeye 4 can reach unrivaled scanning speeds and process large volumes of data independent of any external peripheral devices - a typical feature of all Image Access scanners.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It takes approximately three seconds for the Bookeye 4 to capture and process the images of two pages of a DIN A3 sized book scanned at 200 dpi optical resolution. Once the image is on the screen, modifications can be made to scan parameters such as brightness, color or contrast without having to rescan. Users operate the system intuitively, guided by clear and well structured menu commands on the touchscreen. Scanned images can be saved to a USB flash drive, printed on a connected or network printer, uploaded to an FTP Server or even sent via eMail.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Bookeye 4's solid functionality, innovative features and competitive pricing make it an ideal book copier for large groups of users; for example, in a university library. The advantage of a Bookeye 4 over a normal copier is the protective handling of the subject matter to be scanned and the immediate availability of the resulting images to a wider audience. Distribution of the scanned material can be virtually paper free - an ecological argument for Bookeye 4.

We do a full scan into the scanner memory at full speed, without any stops. We're the only scanner company that does that. Only the time between scanning and output are dependent upon the transfer speed of the network and the computer, and even our transfer rate is twice as fast as competing products because data is transferred to your workstation at 1 Gigabit speeds, while other scanners use significantly slower transfer rates (1/2 Gigabit or less).
