        <h2 class="block-title-sub" id="ILL-0104">... better image quality, fewer errors, and easier operation</h2>

        <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0105">In the early days of digital interlibrary loan and digital document delivery, the available software was simple and image quality expectations of requestors were low. Times have changed. The demand for faster workflow delivery and perfect, printer-ready images has made the current software environment complex, creating significant challenges in training new employees. BSCAN ILL simplifies existing processes and produces perfect, printer-ready images.
        </p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0106">BSCAN ILL starts by eliminating the need to manually enter requestor information. BSCAN ILL automatically reads the information that is required by interlibrary loan document de-
        </p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0107">livery software from scanned pull slips, not only saving time but also eliminating human error.
        </p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0108">Articles are scanned using one of a family of high speed face-up scanners: Click Mini, Click, and Bookeye 4 V3, V2 &amp; V1. By eliminating the constant book flipping required by flatbed scanners, these face-up scanners are three to five times faster than the fastest face-down scanners, and they do not cause book spine damage. For low volume ILL operations, BSCAN ILL also runs BookEdge flatbed scanners, employing their book edge feature and a faster mode that scans two pages at a time.
        </p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0109">Once articles are scanned, BSCAN ILL's powerful image treatment capabilities automatically eliminate skew and remove unwanted black borders, fan and gutter.
        </p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0110">Finally, BSCAN ILL automatically sends requests through ILLiad/Odyssey, Ariel, RAPID, Clio, Article Exchange, Relais, FTP, and e-mail and can notifiy ILLiad/Odyssey in each case, all without any need for further human intervention. Resending articles is also a snap.

Dramatically Improves ILL Digitization</h1>

        <p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0211">A fundamental tenet that has always bound the academic research community together is open sharing of newfound knowledge. Today, this open sharing is going on at a feverish pace and digital interlibrary loan services are an essential vehicle. Scholars from all fields are becoming increasingly dependent on their ability to acquire journal articles in just one day.</p>

        <p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0212">In the early 1990s, the pioneers of interlibrary loan digitization had no choice but to adapt commercial scanning equipment to meet their needs. Ariel was the only available document delivery software and there were no scanners made specifically for scanning books, journals and maps. Over time, that changed. Planetary scanners became available in the late 1990s. The first release of BSCAN ILL automatically read (using OCR) the requestor information from pull slips without manual keying, supported rapid scanning and image cleanup, and automatically posted to Ariel with the press of a single button. Since then, ILLiad, Odyssey, Ariel, RAPID, Clio and Article Exchange have been integrated into BSCAN ILL with the same hands-off automation. BSCAN ILL has a host of valuable features, many of which are not available with any other system.</p>

        <p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0213">In addition to allowing review of electronic articles and resource sharing to reduce per article scanning costs (e.g. for archival, electronic course materials creation, scanning projects), only BSCAN ILL offers you:</p>

        <h3 class="block-title3" id="ILL-0304">SPEED</h3>
        <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0305">All of the systems that DLSG bundles with
            <br> BSCAN ILL are quite fast, but our face up
            <br> scanners are the fastest. By eliminating
            <br> the need to flip the volume repeatedly, our
            <br> face-up scanners are up to 5 times faster
            <br> than the fastest face-down scanners.</p>

        <h3 class="block-title3" id="ILL-0306">ONGOING</h3>

        <p class="block_text2" id="ILL-0610">scanners like those offered by DLSG with BSCAN ILL are 3-5 times faster than the fastest face-down scanners and photo- copiers. And unlike face-down scanners and copiers, DLSG scanners are designed to capture deep into the book fold, flat- ten book curve, split images into two pages and remove fan and gutter.

        <p class="block_text2" id="ILL-0611">BookEdge is uniquely designed for scanning books and is</p>
        <p class="block_text2" id="ILL-0612">the fastest face-down scanner in its price range. When used in book mode (one page at a time), this scanner flattens the page and captures deep into the fold of tightly bound journals. With BSCAN ILL, the BookEdge can also be used to scan 2 pages at a time, which is substantially faster than book mode. BSCAN ILL splits &amp; flattens the pages, and eliminates fan, gutter &amp; skew.</p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="ILL-0703">The exceptional image quality produced by Bookeye and WideTEK scanners affords opportunities for resource shar- ing with Archivists as well as use for projects and creat-
            <br> ing digital course materials. Reduce your cost per article scanned by sharing equipment costs and helping other departments to switch to digital format and get color content without the additional cost of color copiers or color micro- filming.
        </p>

        <p class="block_text2" id="ILL-0704">Use some digitization projects funding
            <br> to purchase the Bookeye
            <br> 4 V1, V2 or V3 and dramatically
            <br> reduce ILL's share of the cost
            <br> of state-of-the-art scanning
            <br> equipment. A complementary schedule
            <br> is usually easy to agree upon. Note that while the
            <br> Bookeye 4 V2's standard image quality (high quality
            <br> 400dpi) meets and exceeds digitization standards, a
            <br> 600dpi option can be purchased later, if desired.</p>

        <p class="block_text3" id="ILL-0705">BSCAN ILL automatically locates the content and sets consistent margins,
            <br> removes fan, gutter and black edges - and even deskews the image.</p>

        <h3 class="block-title4" id="ILL-0708">With its 600dpi option, Bookeye 4 V2 produces the highest quality A2 size (17x25'') images of any face-up scanner today</h3>

        <p class="block_text4" id="ILL-0709">To capture moving objects, digital cameras must use array CCDs, which capture all parts of the object at the same instant. Afford-
            <br> able digital cameras have 50 megapixels or less. And those pixels must be further divided into red, green and blue sub-pixels, which can reduce the clarity of color images by 40%.</p>

        <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0710">Since books don't move while being scanned, Bookeyes employ linear CCD technology to produce ultra-clear images with astounding 140 megapixels. Each pixel in a linear CCD includes full red, green and blue sub-pixels.</p>

        <p class="block_text6" id="ILL-0711">Scanners use linear CCDs. The sweep-
            <br> ing action of scanners allow them to
            <br> capture the precise amount of red, blue
            <br> and green for each pixel.</p>

        <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0712">Bookeye 4 scanners utilize a unique state-of-the-art rotating mirror system that dramatically reduces clarity loss at the corners of the image due to the limitations of lens systems. Bookeyes can also scan in V-mode or flat-mode, and they scan from left to right, allowing them to follow the curves of the book.</p>

        <h1 class="block-title3" id="ILL-0814">Company History</h1>

        <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0815">Our experience in digitization of printed materials dates back to 1988 prior to its founding
            <br> in 1993, when Image Access began providing digitization workflow solutions to commercial
            <br> markets. Having developed its own book and wide format scanners as well as its own OCR,
            <br> barcode reading and image treatment algorithms and a powerful workflow system, Image Access
            <br> is well-equipped to meet both general and specialized digitization needs.</p>
        <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0816">Image Access has a long history of leadership in digital technology. Image Access created Scan2Net®,
            <br> the first Ethernet/HTML based scanner interface, the first self-serve book scanner kiosk, the first and
            <br> only ILL scan, clean-up and delivery workflow system, the first affordable preservation quality large
            <br> format planetary scanner, the first affordable duplex newspaper scanner, the first and only book scanner
            <br> with both flat and v-modes, the first and only complete digitization workflow system, and more. We also
            <br> have the most extensive and prestigious customer list for book scanners in the United States and many
            <br> countries abroad.</p>
        <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0817">Image Access created the Digital Library Systems Group (DLSG) in 2004 to focus on the special needs
            <br> of academic, research and public libraries. And just as Bookeye quickly became the leading book
            <br> scanner, DLSG quickly became the leading supplier of hybrid library products in America, helping the
            <br> most prestigious libraries across America become Digital Age Libraries.</p>
        <p class="block_text5" id="ILL-0818">Image Access has, by far, the largest selection of self-serve book scanners (KIC), the only complete
            <br> turnkey digitization workflow system for creating digital assets and archiving (Opus), and the only
            <br> complete Interlibrary loan scanning and image treatment workflow system (BSCAN ILL). Image
            <br> Access handily succeeds at its ongoing mission of providing the best image quality, the most
            <br> specialized software and the broadest line of digitization products from which a library,
            <br> archive or museum can choose.</p>
