        <p class="block_text" id="CCM-0104">The KIC Click is a high-speed, face-up book capture system at an affordable price. Its sleek and elegant look will complement any library floor. And with its True2Touch<span class="superscript2">TM</span> user interface, KIC Click is as easy to use as it is beautiful. Are there any compromises? You decide.</p>

        <p class="block_text" id="CCM-0105">The KIC Click captures nearly 20 book pages per minute for instant access on tablets, notebooks, smart devices and easy transfer to desktop PCs and servers. With a bed size 30% larger than its nearest competitor, it captures up to 22 x16 inch books and materials at an uncompromising resolution of 300dpi.

        <h1 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0201">KIC Serves Over Half of Students at Universities in America</h1>

        <p class="block_text" id="CCM-0202">In the U.S. alone, KIC serves over four million students at the top "brick and mortar" (non-online) colleges and universities. With the introduction of the KIC BookEdge, KIC Click, and KIC Click Mini, KIC is now affordable for virtually all institutions of higher learning and full-service public libraries. Last decade, libraries typically 'added' several KICs, but since 2010 libraries have begun to replace their entire patron-use copier fleets with self-serve book scanning systems.</p>

        <h1 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0203">A True Digital Age Multifunction System for Academic &amp; Public Libraries</h1>
        <h2 id="CCM-0204">Book Scanning</h2>

        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0205">Students at academic libraries want speed, and "../../images/Dlsg/KIC offers the fastest book scanners on the market. Patrons at public libraries need simplicity, and KIC provides three of the simplest possible user interfaces, one exclusively for scanning, one exclusively for copying and one exclusively for faxing. And KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.</p>

        <h2 id="CCM-0206">Copier Replacement</h2>
        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0207">While multifunction copiers are partly digital, they are big mechanical machines with big</p>

        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0208">
            maintenance issues and tiny touch screens. As a copier replacement, KIC eliminates copier failure/service problems and provides very large touch screens and view screens that are larger still. Organizing (collating, clipping, rotating, etc.) pages on a huge touch screen is much easier than shuffling paper.</p>

        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0209">The digital age has steadily driven down the demand in libraries for paper copies to levels that make it increasingly difficult to justify copiers. KIC self-service scanning systems reduce copier use further - to the point that attaching a small laser or ink jet printer is sufficient. KIC</p>

        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0210">systems also handle much larger materials than copiers, and they scan books without damaging them. However, the most compelling benefit of KIC over copiers is KIC's speed, due mainly to its face-up scanning design, which is not only significantly faster, but far easier to use.</p>

        <h2 id="CCM-0211">Self-Serve Fax</h2>
        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0212">KIC's huge touch screen and larger view screen make faxing extra easy. Users can compose, review, clip, crop and change brightness and contrast of the pages of a fax before sending. KIC's step-by-step process is designed for easy operation by even the most timid users. All you need is an internet connection, and "../../images/Dlsg/KIC will provide the rest at a cost so low that fax revenue can pay for the KIC system in a few years or less.</p>

        <h2 id="CCM-0213">KIC Coins</h2>
        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0214">Printing copies and faxing have per page costs that normally must be passed on to the user. KIC has a free, built-in method of charging users for copies and faxes.</p>
        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0215">Simply print wallet-size "KIC Coins" on regular letter-sized paper in any denomination that you like, cut them out, and sell them to users at the circulation desk or wherever you collect fees for late book returns.</p>

        <h2 id="CCM-0216">KIC Compatible with Copy Card &amp; Cash Systems</h2>
        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0217">All KIC systems are compatible with all standard copy card and coin-op devices. Since KIC transfers images to users' computers electronically, costly expendables are avoided, even for color! The library can opt to keep all revenue it collects.</p>

        <h2 id="CCM-0502">Capture Deep into the Bookfold</h2>

        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0503">KIC Click's Dual Cameras are Set at the Perfect Angles</p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0504">Most books curve at the spine - some rather dramatically. KIC Click gets deep into the bookfold of tightly-bound volumes by capturing from two angles, and easily straightens out the worst curves, producing clear, professional quality images.</p>

        <h2 id="CCM-0505">Capture Area Comparison</h2>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0506">KIC Click's ample 16 X 22 inch capture area is over 50% larger than that of 11x17 inch copiers and twice that of typical consumer scanners. It handles a large percentage of books that are too big for an 11x17 inch scan bed, scanning them two pages at a time without damage to their spines.</p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0507">KIC Click's high speed is derived as much from its ultra-simple, true two-touch interface as from its face-up design that obviates the need to flip books over and over again during the capture process.</p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0508">KIC Click's sleek look and elegant design put the full KIC self-serve digitization functionality into a mere 25 inch width. Its large, 22 inch touch screen and capture surface are at the perfect heights for quick, standing operation when placed on a typical table or its optional K-legs.</p>

        <h3 id="CCM-0509">Fast, Face-Up Scanning that Captures<br>Into the Book Fold Like No Other Machine</h3>
        <h3 id="CCM-0510">Thick Books...No Problem</h3>

        <p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0511">KIC Click handles thick books beautifully.
            <br> Text is clear and undistorted. KIC automatically adds
            <br> margins for print-ready image quality.</p>

        <h2 id="CCM-0512">Capture Oversized Books</h2>
        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0513">KIC Click Mini's generous 12.25 X 19.2 inch capture area is 27% larger than that of 11x17 inch copiers and about twice that of typical consumer scanners. It easily handles books that are too big for an 11x17 inch scan bed, scanning them two pages at a time without damage to their spines.</p>

        <p class="block_text4" id="CCM-0514">Very large volumes can be scanned side-
            <br> ways, one page at a time and rotated.</p>

        <h1 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0601">True 2 Touch<span class="superscript">TM</span> User Interface</h1>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0604">Ease-of-use is a central feature of KIC. The KIC Click's large touch screen and its large "Scan" and "Save, Send or Print" buttons that occupy a very large portion of the touch screen clearly convey how easy KIC is to use. The Save button defaults to an output method and file format that is selectable by the institution. If a flash drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it will save to the flash drive. Users can override the default output method by manually selecting one or more alternative methods of output.</p>

            <li>KIC is very agile, and allows the user to jump from just about anywhere in the touch screen system to just about anywhere else, directly and usually with a single touch. This modern, 'modeless' design is easier to use, but difficult to create.</li>
            <li>KIC's large buttons and controls are easy to use, even for people with unsteady hands.</li>
            <li>KIC gradually expands and contracts controls such as brightness, con- trast and DPI so users can easliy follow their screen activity</li>
            <li>KIC doesn't delete original images when you clip a photo or excerpt of text unless you tell it to.</li>
            <li>KIC lets you output to many different destinations in a single session.</li>
            <li>Once you've scanned a document, you can change your mind as to where you would like it to output. For example, you may have wanted to save to USB, but learned your USB drive is full. Or you may scan so much that it exceeds your email limit. Or after scanning and collating a mass of research, you decide that you want to share the research with others.</li>

        <h1 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0612">Two Large Screens for Simplicity &amp; Power</h1>

        <p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0613">It's easy to undervalue screen size. For 20 years, all cell- phone makers relentlessly pursued smaller and smaller screens until very recently when one company reversed that trend. They realized that people want the largest screen that will fit in their pocket/purse and hand. This is because dis- play screens are our window to the digital world, and touch screens give us control over that world.</p>

        <p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0614">As big as self-serve scanning systems are, it makes sense to have a very large touch screen. And with the low prices for high quality displays, it is compelling to add a separate display screen. In 2002, "../../images/Dlsg/KIC realized this, when the first KIC system was designed. Today, with nearly 10 years more experience than any other vendor, "../../images/Dlsg/KIC has the most under- standable, easy to use and powerful user interface for self- serve book scanning, and it's based on dual screens.</p>

        <p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0615">The view screen shows very large, clear images of what you've scanned, allowing the touch screen to have big, easy to understand buttons and other controls.</p>

        <p class="block_text4" id="CCM-0616">Display screens are our portals into the digital world, and touch screens are the easiest way to control that world. That's why "../../images/Dlsg/KIC provides large, 24 inch,
            <br> full HD displays and equally large touch screens with most of its KIC systems.</p>

        <h1 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0801">KIC Bookeye vs. Copiers - How KIC Compares</h1>
        <h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0802">Copiers are Outmoded</h2>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0803">Since the first KIC was delivered to a library in 2004, the days of photocopiers for patron use in libraries were numbered. And now with the rapid explosion of tablet computers and electronic readers, the demand in academic libraries for electronic copies has substantially outstripped the demand for printed copies. The demand for electronic copies in public libraries is also reaching a tipping point.</p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0804">The ability to capture hundreds of pages of research into a tablet or electronic reader and search through that material on the Inter- net with a tablet, eReader or notebook PC that can be used just about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely valuable. In this digital age, academic libraries are compelled to go hybrid for three reasons: 1) the high demand for digital content; 2) their ex- isting print collections contain vast amounts of information that cannot be found on the Internet; and 3) students are receptive to the price of electronic copies - typically free.</p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0805">So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo copiers? There are three main factors that keep the cost of photo- copies high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner and ink; 2) photo-</p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0806">copiers require a lot of maintenance due to the number of moving parts; and 3) all major photocopier brands use a distributed service model.</p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0807">In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC because KIC has split the scan/copy functions into three separate machines, choosing the best of breed for each. As a result, KIC offers the best book scanners by themselves or with a loose-leaf paper (ADF) scanner. Virtually any off-the-shelf laser or inkjet printer can be added to any KIC system, so you can optimize costs and speeds, and offer affordable color.</p>

        <p id="CCM-0808">ADF attachment scans
            <br> 40 loose-leaf pages/min
            <br> (20 sheets per minute)</p>

        <h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0809">Click vs. Copiers</h2>

        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0810">This graph compares the total costs of one color KIC Click system with two color copiers and with two black and white copiers. Both copiers are the kinds typically seen in academic libraries. One KIC Click is compared with two copiers because its face-up operation yields well over two times the performance of a typical copier. The costs are broken into three main</p>

        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0811">areas: equipment and maintenance, consumables, and patron usage time. With KIC Click, electronic output is assumed to be preferred over print 90% of the time. That ratio has ranged from 75-95% electronic in 2012, but is certain to rise in the future.</p>

        <h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0812">No More Book Spine Damage!</h2>

        <p class="block_text8" id="CCM-0813">Thick books with stiff spines and content that runs deep into the bookfold are often damaged when copied. KIC Click easily captures content without damaging book spines.</p>

        <p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0814">KIC automatically removes black
            <br> edges, straightens content, and
            <br> produces clean, professional look-
            <br> ing images - important for elec-
            <br> tronic reserves, course curriculum
            <br> materials and research reports.</p>

        <p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0826">These automatic image treatment
            <br> functions also save a lot of admin-
            <br> istrator, faculty, and student time.</p>

        <h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0815">Thick Books...No Problem</h2>

        <p class="block_text4" id="CCM-0816">KIC Click &amp; Click Mini handle thick books beautifully. Their
            <br> contour-finding lasers allow it to flatten even the most curved
            <br> books and produce text that is clear and undistorted. KIC
            <br> automatically adds margins for print-ready image quality.</p>

        <h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0817">Click Mini Scans 3 Times Faster</h2>

        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0818">Statistics from five million scanning sessions across America re- vealed a median session length of 23 pages. So, most of the time spent during a KIC session is spent scanning. Face up scanning has been proven to be three times faster than face down scanning.</p>

        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0819">So why is speed so important?</p>

        <ul class="peppermint" id="CCM-0820">
            <li>It's economical. One Click can replace multiple copiers or other face-down scanning machines.</li>
            <li>It gives patrons another reason to visit your library.</li>
            <li>It's green. The faster it is, the more use it will get and the less the copier will be used.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="block_text5" id="CCM-0821">In the digital world, there is no paper, toner or ink, so li- braries rarely charge for images, whether black and white or color.
        </p>

        <p class="block_text5" id="CCM-0822">Over the years, many libraries experimented with color copiers, but could never find a formula that worked. If the fees were low, patrons would copy materials with so much color that the library would spend more on ink than the fees they were col- lecting. If the fees were too high, the usage would be so low that the cost of the machine couldn't be justified.
        </p>

        <p class="block_text5" id="CCM-0823">KIC calculates the amount of color in an image before it is printed. So the fee for copies with a little bit of color can be the same as the fee for black and white copies. If a copy has a lot of color, the fee can be increased in proportion to the cost of the color ink or toner. This wonderful feature should be a simple, easy byproduct of the digital age, and it is with KIC.</p>

        <h3 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0902">Faster is also Easier</h3>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0903">Face-up book scanning is far easier on both patrons and books and quite a bit faster than face-down scanning.</p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0904">Scanning books face-up makes it much easier to keep track of what pages you've scanned. With KIC Click, Click Mini and other face-up scanners, books stay face up, so you can see what you're scanning as you scan it. This extra visibility elim- inates the age old problem of skipping pages and scanning pages out of order which can occur with face-down scanners.</p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0905">The following photo sequences show the reason that facedown scanning systems are typically 1/3 the speed of faceup systems. The book flipping necessary to scan a book on a face-down scanner like the KIC BookEdge is shown in the photo sequence below. It's a workout both for the book and the patron.</p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0906">The ergonomic design of the face-up scanning sytems involves only the basic movement required to set a book down and turn a page.</p>

        <p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0916">In contrast, the sequence on the left shows the relative speed and ease of face-up scanning systems that do not require the user to flip over the book being scanned. Once placing the book, the user simply turns pages and presses the scan button (or foot pedal) to scan two pages at a time.</p>

        <h1 class="block-title2" id="CCM-1001">The Hybrid Library</h1>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-1002">To fully earn the 'hybrid library' designation, a library's existing print collections must be available in digital format. KIC systems allow your students and faculty to select material for quick and easy self-serve digiti- zation, providing a valuable conduit between your print collections and patron tablets, PCs, eReaders and smart devices.</p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-1003">KIC's self-serve digitize-on-demand capabilities leverage your library's most valuable assets - its print collections.</p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-1004">Digital images don't have the limitations of physical copies. They can instantly be shared with fellow researchers around the world via email or Cloud, dramatically facilitating collaboration.</p>

        <p class="block_text1" id="CCM-1005">KIC avoids the digital rights management conundrum. Each digitization is for a single use, but thousands of patrons can digi- tize content from the same book, yet preserve the book's spine.</p>

        <h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-1006">Resource Sharing</h2>

        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-1007">We know the importance of resource sharing. To help squeeze more value out of your investment, KIC can be configured to support the BSCAN Interlibrary Loan system, the Opus Digitiza- tion Workflow system, and general ad hoc scanning.</p>

        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-1008">Use a USB flash drive to enable other types of scanning at a KIC station and temporarily access shared folders on a network. When you unplug the USB, the KIC station automatically returns to its regular self-serve scanning station functionality.</p>

        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-1009">For general purpose scanning by ad- ministrators and faculty, simply write a department password file to a flash drive. When a user plugs in the USB 'key', KIC recognizes the password and allows the user to save scanned images to shared folders.</p>

        <h2 class="block-title2" id="CCM-1010">Premium Maintenance Plan</h2>

        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-1011">Image Access has an unmatched service and support record. It is impos- sible to affordably provide service personnel living in every city and town across America that are highly trained on the very special technologies needed by libraries. Instead, "../../images/Dlsg/KIC designs remote serviceability into its products and has perfected remote diagnosis and when possible, repair.</p>

        <p class="block_text2" id="CCM-1012">The resulting savings allows "../../images/Dlsg/KIC to frequently and promptly provide loaner/swap-out equipment and to go on site whenever necessary to maintain and repair equipment, minimizing interruptions in service for your patrons.</p>

                    <h2 class="product-tab mint">Click™, Click Mini - developed specifically for the self-service market</h2>
                    <div class="product-tab">
                        <p>
                            When people see the new KIC Click™ or Click Mini for the first time, the most common expression is "it's so beautiful." And with True2Touch, it's as easy to use as it is beautiful. Our new and exciting Click Mini book scanner achieves a far more affordable price point for face-up book scanning than ever before. Are there any compromises? You decide.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The KIC Click™ captures book content as fast as 1 page per second! With a bed size 30% larger than its nearest competitor, it captures up to 21x16 inch books and materials at an uncompromising resolution of 300dpi.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The KIC Click Mini captures 30 book pages per minute! It produces sharp, clear images in full color at 300dpi for instant access on tablets, notebooks, smart devices and easy transfer to desktop PCs and servers. Its 12.25 x 19.2 inch bed size is significantly larger than double-letter and is large enough for most book pages. Very large books can be scanned one page at a time sideways and the images rotated. And of course, it handles loose paper and other flat material, too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Photocopiers, PCs, monitors and keyboards clutter up otherwise beautiful libraries across America. The smooth, triple-layer, pearlescent white KIC Click™ totally reverses that trend. It adds beauty to the most beautiful libraries. Inspired by an outstanding effort of the fledgling tablet industry to turn technology into something more like jewelry or a fashion accessory than a computer, the pearlescent KIC Click™ evokes comments like, "We care about the appearance of our library and this machine is over the top!"
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="product-tab">
                        <p>
                            The KIC Click™ and Click Mini perfectly complete the KIC family of self-serve digitizing systems. The KIC Bookeye 4 has the most durable production book scanner, the only book scanner with both V-cradle and flat modes, and the highest quality 600dpi of any scanner. The KIC Clicks are small, fast and beautiful, and the KIC BookEdge is cheaper than most floor standing black-and-white photocopiers. And since none of them use toner or paper, they're environmentally friendly and ultimately far cheaper to run than copiers.

                            The Click™'s and Click Mini's sleek look and elegant design put the full KIC self-serve digitization functionality into a mere 25(Click) / 20(Click Mini) inch width. It's large, 23(Click) / 22(Click Mini) inch touch screen and capture surface are at the perfect heights when placed on a typical table or desktop. Both Click™ and Click Mini also have an optional matching stand for freestanding operation. The optional KIC SmartDock feature can transfer 10-20 full-color pages per second directly to any smart device.

                            Unlike copiers and flatbed scanners, both KIC Click™ and Click Mini allow users to digitize books face-up, without damaging books by having to press them hard against a glass plate. The Click™'s / Click Mini's lightening speed is derived as much from its fast opto-electronics as from the fact that its face-up design obviates the need to flip books over and over again during the digitization process.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="product-tab">
                        <p>
                            The Click™ and Click Mini produce beautiful, full-color images at no additional cost over black &amp; white images! Searchable PDF's and editable text files are a snap to create. As with all KIC self-serve systems, scanner's text-to-speech capability produces audio files that can be played in any MP3 player. Studying and research have never been so easy!
