            <div class="bscan-ill__column">
                <p>In the early days of digital interlibrary loan and digital
                    document delivery, the available software was simple‘ and
                    image quality expectations of requestors were low. ‘Fmes
                    have changed. The demand for faster workﬂow delivery and
                    perfect, printer-ready images has made the current software
                    environment complex, creating signiﬁcant challenges in
                    training new employees. BSCAN ILL simpliﬁes existing
                    processes and produces perfect, printer-ready images.</p>
                <p>BSCAN ILL starts by eliminating the need to manually enter
                    requestor information. BSCAN ILL automatically reads the
                    information that is required by interlibrary loan document
                    delivery software from scanned pull slips, not only saving
                    time but also eliminating human error.</p>

            <div class="bscan-ill__column">
                <p>Articles are scanned using one of a family of high speed
                    faoe-up scanners: Click Mini, Click, and Bookeye 4 V3, V2
                    & V1. By eliminating the constant book ﬂipping required
                    by ﬂatbed scanners, these face-up scanners are three to
                    five times faster than the fastest face-down scanners, and
                    they do not cause book spine damage. For low volume
                    ILL operations, BSCAN ILL also runs BookEdge ﬂatbed
                    scanners, employing their book edge feature and a faster
                    mode that scans two pages at a time.</p>
                <p>Once articles are scanned, BSCAN ILL’s powerful image
                    treatment capabilities automatically eliminate skew and
                    remove unwanted black borders, fan and gutter.</p>
                <p>Finally, BSCAN ILL automatically sends requests through
                    lLLiad/Odyssey, Ariel, RAPID, Clio, Article Exchange,
                    Relais, FTP, and e-mail and can notiﬁy lLLiad/Odyssey
                    in each case, all without any need for further human
                    intervention. Resending articles is also a snap.</p>

                <p>A fundamental tenet that has always bound the academic
                    research community together is open sharing of newfound
                    knowledge. Today, this open sharing is going on at a feverish
                    pace and digital interlibrary loan services are an essential vehicle.
                    Scholars from all fields are becoming increasingly dependent on
                    their ability to acquire journal articles in just one day.</p>
                <p>In the early 1990s, the pioneers of interlibrary loan digitization
                    had no choice but to adapt commercial scanning equipment to
                    meet their needs. Ariel was the only available document delivery
                    software and there were no scanners made specifically for
                    scanning books, journals and maps. Over time, that changed.
                    Planetary scanners became available in the late 1990s. The ﬁrst
                    release of BSCAN ILL automatically read (using OCR) the
                    requestor information from pull slips without manual keying,
                    supported rapid scanning and image cleanup, and automatically
                    posted to Ariel with the press of a single button. Since then,
                    lLLiad, Odyssey, Ariel, RAPID, Clio and Article Exchange have
                    been integrated into BSCAN ILL with the same hands-off
                    automation. BSCAN ILL has a host of valuable features, many of
                    which are not available with any other system.</p>

                <h2 class="brochure-title-left">Deep into the Book Foldt</h2>
                <p>Bound journals often have content deep into the book fold. It is
                    quite difficult and sometimes impossible to capture this content
                    with a typical flatbed scanner or photocopier.</p>
                <p>There are three methods for effectively capturing this content:</p>
                <ul class="blue-doth blue-bullet">
                    <li>Scanning in the direction of the curve and reducing

                <p>Bookeye 4 scanners employ the first method, which requires high
                    resolution optics. Bookeye 4’s left-to-right scanning allows it to
                    follow the contours of virtually any book. allowing it to capture
                    deep into the book fold and decompress the compressed con-
                    tent. This feature combined with its advanced lighting system
                    and superior optics also allows the Bookeye 4 to produce better
                    quality 600 dpi images than any other book scanner available.</p>
                <p>The second method is employed by Click scanners, which have
                    two cameras. Both the Bookeye 4 and the Click are face-up
                    scanners, which are faster and easier to use than face-down
                    scanners, while our BookEdge has the lowest initial cost.</p>
                <p>Bookeye 4 and Click scanners both have laser curve sensor sys-
                    tems that allows them to easily straighten out the worst curves
                    and produce clear, professional quality images.</p>

            A fundamental tenet that has always bound the
            academic research community together is open sharing
            of newfound knowledge. Today, this open sharing
            is going on at a feverish pace and digital interlibrary
            loan services are an important vehicle. Scholars from
            all ﬁelds are becoming increasingly dependent on
            their ability to acquire journal articles in just one day.
            <br>
            In the early 1990s, the pioneers of interlibrary loan
            digitization had no choice but to adapt commercial
            scanning equipment to meet their needs. Ariel was the
            only available document delivery software and there
        </span>
        <span class="page3__inline">
            were no scanners made speciﬁcally for scanning books,
            journals and maps. Over time, that changed. Planetary
            scanners became available in the late 1990s. The ﬁrst
            release of BSCAN ILL automatically read (using OCR)
            the requestor information from pull slips without manual
            keying, supported rapid scanning and image cleanup,
            and automatically posted to Ariel with the press of a single
            button. Since then, |LLiad, Odyssey, Ariel, RAPID, Clio
            and Article Exchange have been integrated into BSCAN
            ILL with the same hands-off automation. Today, BSCAN
            ILL has a host of valuable features, many of which are not
            available with any other system.

                    <p>The sequence above shows just how much work is required
                        to use a face-down scanner to scan multiple pages.

                    <p>In contrast, the sequence on the left shows the relative
                        speed and ease of face-up scanning systems that do not
                        require the user to ﬂip over the book being scanned. Once
                        placing the book, the user simply turns pages and presses
                        the scan button (or foot pedal) to scan two pages at a time.</p>
