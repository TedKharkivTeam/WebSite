        <h2 class="brochure-title-center">KIC Serves Over Half of Students at Universities in America</h2>
        <p>
            In the U.S. alone, KIC serves over four million students at the top "brick and mortar" (non-online)
            colleges and universities. With the introduction of the KIC BookEdge, KIC Click, and KIC Click Mini,
            KIC is now affordable for virtually all institutions of higher learning and full-service public
            libraries. Last decade, libraries typically 'added' several KICs, but since 2010 libraries have begun to
            replace their entire patron-use copier fleets with self-serve book scanning systems.

        <h2 class="brochure-title-center">A True Digital Age Multifunction System for Academic &amp; Public Libraries</h2>
        <img id="scan-diagram" src="../images/JPGs for KIC Click &amp; Click Mini Brochure/ScanDiagram.png" alt="">
        <h2>Book Scanning</h2>
        <p>
            Students at academic libraries want speed, and DLSG offers the fastest book scanners on the market.
            Patrons at public libraries need simplicity, and KIC provides three of the simplest possible user
            interfaces, one exclusively for scanning, one exclusively for copying and one exclusively for faxing.
            And KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.
        </p>
        <img id="copy-diagram" src="../images/JPGs for KIC Click &amp; Click Mini Brochure/CopyDiagram.png" alt="">
        <h2>Copier Replacement</h2>
        <p>
            While multifunction copiers are partly digital, they are big mechanical machines with big maintenance
            issues and tiny touch screens. As a copier replacement, KIC eliminates copier failure/service problems
            and provides very large touch screens and view screens that are larger still. Organizing (collating,
            clipping, rotating, etc.) pages on a huge touch screen is much easier than shuffling paper.
        </p>
        <p>
            The digital age has steadily driven down the demand in libraries for paper copies to levels that make
            it increasingly difficult to justify copiers. KIC self-service scanning systems reduce copier use further
            — to the point that attaching a small laser or ink jet printer is sufficient.
            <img id="fax-diagram" src="../images/JPGs for KIC Click &amp; Click Mini Brochure/FaxDiagram.png" alt="">
            KIC systems also handle
            much larger materials than copiers, and they scan books without damaging them. However, the most compelling
            benefit of KIC over copiers is KIC's speed, due mainly to its face-up scanning design, which is not only
            significantly faster, but far easier to use.
        </p>
        <h2>Self-Serve Fax</h2>
        <p>
            KIC's huge touch screen and larger view screen make faxing extra easy. Users can compose, review, clip,
            crop and change brightness and contrast of the pages of a fax before sending. KIC's step-by-step process is
            designed for easy operation by even the most timid users. All you need is an internet connection, and DLSG
            will provide the rest at a cost so low that fax revenue can pay for the KIC system in a few years or less.

            <p class="texting2">
                All KIC systems are compatible with all standard copy card and coin-op devices. Since KIC transfers images to users' computers electronically, costly expendables are avoided, even for color!
                The library can opt to keep all revenue it collects.
