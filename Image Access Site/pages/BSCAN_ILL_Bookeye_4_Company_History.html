        <h2>Resource Sharing</h2>
        <span>Share with Archivist & Digital Course Materials Creation</span>
        <p>The exceptional image quality produced by Bookeye and WideTEK scanners affords opportunities for resource
            shar- ing with Archivists as well as use for projects and creat-
            ing digital course materials. Reduce your cost per article scanned by sharing equipment costs and helping
            other departments to switch to digital format and get color content without the additional cost of color
            copiers or color micro- filming.</p>
        <p>Use some digitization projects funding
            to purchase the Bookeye
            4 V1, V2 or V3 and dramatically
            reduce ILL's share of the cost
            of state-of-the-art scanning
            equipment. A complementary schedule
            is usually easy to agree upon. Note that while the
            Bookeye 4 V2's standard image quality (high quality
            400dpi) meets and exceeds digitization standards, a
            600dpi option can be purchased later, if desired.</p>

        <h2>The Amazing Image Quality of the Bookeye 4 V2 600dpi Option</h2>
        <span>With its 600dpi option, Bookeye 4 V2 produces the highest quality A2 size
            (17x25'') images of any face-up scanner today</span>
        <p>To capture moving objects, digital cameras must use array CCDs, which capture all parts of the object at the
            same instant. Afford-
            able digital cameras have 50 megapixels or less. And those pixels must be further divided into red, green
            and blue sub-pixels, which can reduce the clarity of color images by 40%.</p>

        <span>The Bayer Pattern is used by
            digital cameras to capture color images</span>
        <p>Since books don't move while being scanned, Bookeyes employ linear CCD technology to produce ultra-clear
            images with astounding 140 megapixels. Each pixel in a linear CCD includes full red, green and blue
            sub-pixels.</p>
        <img src="../images/scan9.png" width="389" height="132" alt="BSCAN">
        <span>Scanners use linear CCDs. The sweep-
            ing action of scanners allow them to
            capture the precise amount of red, blue
            and green for each pixel.</span>
        <p>Bookeye 4 scanners utilize a unique state-of-the-art rotating mirror system that dramatically reduces clarity
            loss at the corners of the image due to the limitations of lens systems. Bookeyes can also scan in V-mode or
            flat-mode, and they scan from left to right, allowing them to follow the curves of the book.</p>
        <h2>Resize ILL Operations with No Penalty</h2>
        <span>DLSG's exclusive trade-up, interchange and re-purpose programs are among
            the best reasons to choose DLSG for your institution's digitization needs</span>

        <h2>Premium Maintenance Plan</h2>
        <p>Image Access has an unmatched service and support record. It is impossible to affordably provide service
            personnel living in every city and town across America that are highly trained on the very special
            technologies needed by libraries. Instead, DLSG designs remote ser- viceability into its products and has
            perfected remote di- agnosis and when possible, repair.</p>
        <p>The resulting savings allows DLSG to frequently and promptly provide loaner/swap-out equip- ment and to go on
            site whenever necessary to maintain and repair equipment, minimizing interruptions in service.</p>

        <h2>Company History</h2>
        <p>Our experience in digitization of printed materials dates back to 1988 prior to its founding
            in 1993, when Image Access began providing digitization WorkFlow solutions to commercial
            markets. Having developed its own book and wide format scanners as well as its own OCR,
            barcode reading and image treatment algorithms and a powerful WorkFlow system, Image Access
            is well-equipped to meet both general and specialized digitization needs.</p>
        <p>Image Access has a long history of leadership in digital technology. Image Access created Scan2Net&reg;,
            the first Ethernet/HTML based scanner interface, the first self-serve book scanner kiosk, the first and
            only ILL scan, clean-up and delivery WorkFlow system, the first affordable preservation quality large
            format planetary scanner, the first affordable duplex newspaper scanner, the first and only book scanner
            with both flat and v-modes, the first and only complete digitization WorkFlow system, and more. We also
            have the most extensive and prestigious customer list for book scanners in the United States and many
            countries abroad.</p>
        <p>Image Access created the Digital Library Systems Group (DLSG) in 2004 to focus on the special needs
            of academic, research and public libraries. And just as Bookeye quickly became the leading book
            scanner, DLSG quickly became the leading supplier of hybrid library products in America, helping the
            most prestigious libraries across America become Digital Age Libraries.</p>
        <p>Image Access has, by far, the largest selection of self-serve book scanners (KIC), the only complete
            turnkey digitization WorkFlow system for creating digital assets and archiving (Opus), and the only
            complete Interlibrary loan scanning and image treatment WorkFlow system (BSCAN ILL). Image
            Access handily succeeds at its ongoing mission of providing the best image quality, the most
            specialized software and the broadest line of digitization products from which a library,
            archive or museum can choose.</p>
