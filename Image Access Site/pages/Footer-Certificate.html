            Products</h2>
        <p>At a time when our competition has been busy focusing on their companies being bought, sold or reorganized,
            Image Access has focused on the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers worldwide.
            This has allowed Image Access to continue to offer the best wide format scanner solutions in the industry at
            remarkably low prices, all of which are a benefit to the customer.</p>
        <img class="infoblock__certificate" src="../images/maintenance_agreement.jpg" alt="Maintenance Agreement">
        <p>In February 2016, Image Access proved that quality is key to the development, manufacturing and sales of our
            scanners by successfully attaining ISO 9001:2015 certification. ISO 9001:2015 is the latest version of the
            quality management systems standard, which helps organizations demonstrate to customers that they can offer
            products and services of consistently good quality. This version was first published at the end of 2015 and
            Image Access is one of the first companies in the industry to complete the certification process.</p>
        <p>Image Access scanners can boast unrivaled performance with the highest quality and security at the lowest
            connectivity cost. These business critical advantages are due to the progressive technological platform on
            which all Image Access products run - <a href="Footer-Factory-Tour-Scan2Net.html">Scan2Net</a>. <a
                    href="KIC-Bookeye-4.html">The Bookeye</a> planetary and <a
                    href="Scanners_Wide_Format_Scanners.html">WideTEK wide format</a> and <a
                    href="Scanners_Flatbed_Scanners.html">WideTEK flatbed</a>
            families of large format scanners cannot be beaten for scanning speed, image precision, color accuracy and
            ease of use.</p>
        <p>We have built a user experience that is unmatched: Standalone systems, walk-up scanning and full operation
            via internal or external touchscreens or mobile devices are all design considerations which Image Access has
            included in their products for many years.</p>
        <p>Image Access delivers large format scanners of all sizes and types to thousands of locations in nearly every
            country around the globe. Whether you are in libraries, archives, universities, museums, industrial
            complexes, government agencies, repro shops or smaller commercial locations, you are likely to encounter one
            or more of our scanners.</p>
