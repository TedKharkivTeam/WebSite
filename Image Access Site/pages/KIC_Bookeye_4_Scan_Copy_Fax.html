        <p class="infoblock__block_text">In the U.S. alone, KIC serves over four million students at the top "brick and
            mortar" (non-online) colleges and universities. With
            the introduction of the KIC BookEdge, KIC Click, and KIC Click Mini, KIC is now affordable for virtually all
            institutions of higher
            learning and full-service public libraries. Last decade, libraries typically 'added' several KICs, but since
            2010 libraries have begun
            to replace their entire patron-use copier fleets with self-serve book scanning systems.</p>

                    book
                    scanners on the market. Patrons at public libraries need simplicity, and KIC
                    provides three of the simplest possible user interfaces, one exclusively for
                    scanning, one exclusively for copying and one exclusively for faxing. And
                    KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.</p>

                <h2 class="infoblock__block-title3">Copier Replacement</h2>
                <p class="infoblock__block_text2">
                    While multifunction copiers are partly digital,
                    they are big mechanical machines with big
                    maintenance issues and tiny touch screens. As a copier replacement, KIC eliminates copier
                    failure/service problems and provides very large touch screens and view screens that are larger
                    still. Organizing (collating, clipping, rotating, etc.) pages on a huge touch screen is much easier
                    than shuffling paper.</p>

                <p class="infoblock__block_text2">The digital age has steadily driven down the demand in libraries for
                    paper
                    copies to levels that
                    make it increasingly difficult to justify copiers. KIC self-service scanning systems reduce copier
                    use further - to the point that attaching a small laser or ink jet printer is sufficient.</p>
                <p class="infoblock__block_text2"> KIC systems also handle much larger materials than copiers, and they
                    scan books without damaging them. However, the most
                    compelling benefit of KIC over copiers is KIC's speed, due
                    mainly to its face-up scanning design, which is not only
                    significantly faster, but far easier to use.</p>

                <p class="infoblock__block_text2">KIC's huge touch screen and larger view screen make faxing extra easy.
                    Users
                    can compose,
                    review, clip, crop and change brightness and contrast of the pages of a fax before sending. KIC's
                    step-by-step process is designed for easy operation by even the most timid users. All you need is
                    an internet connection, and DLSG will provide the rest at a cost so low that fax revenue can pay for
                    the KIC system in a few years or less.</p>

                    Since KIC transfers images to users' computers
                    electronically, costly expendables
                    are avoided, even for color! The library
                    can opt to keep all revenue it collects.</p>
