            <h2 class="brochure-title-center">KIC Serves Over Half of Students at Universities in America</h2>
            <p>
                In the U.S. alone, KIC serves over four million students at the top "brick and mortar" (non-online)
                colleges and universities. With the introduction of the KIC BookEdge, KIC Click, and KIC Click Mini,
                KIC is now affordable for virtually all institutions of higher learning and full-service public
                libraries. Last decade, libraries typically 'added' several KICs, but since 2010 libraries have begun to
                replace their entire patron-use copier fleets with self-serve book scanning systems.

            <h2 class="brochure-title-center">A True Digital Age Multifunction System for Academic &amp; Public
                Libraries</h2>
            <img id="scan-diagram" src="../images/brochure-pictures/TriangularScan.png" alt="">
            <h2>Book Scanning</h2>
            <p>
                Students at academic libraries want speed, and DLSG offers the fastest book scanners on the market.
                Patrons at public libraries need simplicity, and KIC provides three of the simplest possible user
                interfaces, one exclusively for scanning, one exclusively for copying and one exclusively for faxing.
                And KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.
            </p>
            <img id="copy-diagram" src="../images/brochure-pictures/TriangularCopy.png" alt="">
            <h2>Copier Replacement</h2>
            <p>
                While multifunction copiers are partly digital, they are big mechanical machines with big maintenance
                issues and tiny touch screens. As a copier re
                placement, KIC eliminates copier failure/service problems
                and provides very large touch screens and view screens that are larger still. Organizing (collating,
                clipping, rotating, etc.) pages on a huge touch screen is much easier than shuffling paper.
            </p>
            <p>
                The digital age has steadily driven down the demand in libraries for paper copies to levels that make
                it increasingly difficult to justify copiers. KIC self-service scanning systems reduce copier use
                further
                — to the point that attaching a small laser or ink jet printer is sufficient.
                <img id="fax-diagram" src="../images/JPGs for KIC Click &amp; Click Mini Brochure/FaxDiagram.png"
                     alt="">
                KIC systems also handle
                much larger materials than copiers, and they scan books without damaging them. However, the most
                compelling
                benefit of KIC over copiers is KIC's speed, due mainly to its face-up scanning design, which is not only
                significantly faster, but far easier to use.
            </p>
            <h2>Self-Serve Fax</h2>
            <p>
                KIC's huge touch screen and larger view screen make faxing extra easy. Users can compose, review, clip,
                crop and change brightness and contrast of the pages of a fax before sending. KIC's step-by-step process
                is
                designed for easy operation by even the most timid users. All you need is an internet connection, and
                DLSG
                will provide the rest at a cost so low that fax revenue can pay for the KIC system in a few years or
                less.

                        do
                        not require the user to flip the book twice for each page. KIC analyzes each image, and
                        automatically splits it into two separate images. In addition, black edges are automatically
                        removed
                        and the content is straightened, producing clean, professional looking images - important for
                        electronic reserves, course curriculum materials and research reports. These automatic image
                        treatment functions also save a lot of faculty, administrator, and student time.</p>

            <p class="infoblock__page-4__text6">With its 600dpi option, Bookeye 4 is the only true preservation quality book scanner that's
                also ideal for self-service.</p>
            <p class="infoblock__page-4__text-block-left">To capture moving objects, digital cameras must use array
                CCDs, which
                capture all parts of the object at the
                same instant. That's why affordable digital cameras have fewer than 50 megapixels. And those pixels must
                be
                further divided into red, green and blue sub-pixels.</p>

            <p class="infoblock__page-4__margine">Since books don't move while being scanned, the Bookeye 4 is able to
                utilize
                linear CCD technology to produce
                ultra-clear images with astounding 140 megapixels. Each pixel in a linear CCD includes full red, green
                and
                blue sub-pixels. </p>
            <img class="infoblock__page-4__scanner" src="../images/Dlsg/KIC/Page_1_ScannerWithArrows.png" alt="123">
            <p class="infoblock__page-4__margine"> However, high resolution scanning is meaningless if the lens system
                does not
                produce highly
                focused images. Since ultra-high resolution "spy satellite" lenses are quite expensive, the Bookeye 4
                scans
                from left to right, allowing it to follow the
                curve of an open book and maintain excellent focus, whether in V-mode or flat mode.</p>
            <p class="infoblock__page-4__homo-text">&#9668; The Bookeye 4's left-to-right scanning allows it to follow the
                contours of
                virtu- ally any book, producing better 600 dpi images than other book scanners that claim to produce 600
                dpi

            <p class="infoblock__page-5__block-header-2">Faster is also Easier</p>

            <p class="infoblock__page-5__text-block">The following photo sequences show the reason that face-down
                scanning
                system are typically 1/3 the speed of face-up systems. The book flipping
                necessary to scan a book on a face-down scanner like the KIC BookEdge
                is shown in the photo sequence below. It's a workout both for the book
                and the patron. </p>
            <p class="infoblock__page-5__text-block">The ergonomic design of the face-up scanning systems
                involves only the basic movement required to set a book down and turn a page.</p>


            <p class="infoblock__page-5__dvfu3">Face-up book scanning is far easier on both
                patrons and books and quite a bit faster than face-down scanning.</p>

            <p>Scanning books face-up makes it much easier to keep track
                of what pages you've scanned. With KIC Click, Click Mini and other face-up scanners,
                books stay face up, so you can see what you're scanning as
                you scan it. This extra visibility eliminates the age old problem
                of skipping pages and scanning pages out of order which can occur
                with face-down scanners.</p>

                    If
                    a flash drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it will

                        it is important to know which KIC systems are

                        day and week, and which are used the least.
                        All usage statistics can help you to determine
                        the best KIC configuration for each site. And

                        work to improve KIC and support the growing changing
                        digital world. DLSG offers improved software regularly, and

                        lets you update KIC systems remotely. For example, a
                        recently released feature lets you turn KIC systems on and

                            <p>Since the first KIC was delivered to an academic library in 2004, the days of
                                photocopiers for
                                patron

                                in academic libraries and even public libraries were numbered. And now with the rapid
                                explosion
                                of
                                tablet computers and electronic readers, the demand in academic libraries for electronic
                                copies
                                has
                                substantially outstripped the de- mand for printed copies. The demand for electronic
                                copies in
                                public
                                libraries is also reaching a tipping point.</p>
                            <p>The ability to capture virtually unlimited numbers of pages of research into a tablet or
                                electronic

                                be used just about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely valuable. In this digital
                                age,
                                academic
                                libraries are compelled to go hybrid for three reasons: 1) the high demand for digital
                                content;
                                2)
                                their
                                existing print collections contain vast amounts of information that cannot be found on
                                the
                                Internet;
                                and
                                3) students are receptive to the price of electronic copies - typically free.</p>
                            <p>So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo copiers? There are three
                                main
                                factors
                                that
                                keep the cost of photo- copies high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner and ink; 2)
                                photo-
                                copiers
                                require a lot of maintenance due to the number of moving parts; and 3) all major
                                photocopier
                                brands
                                use
                                a distributed service model.</p>
                            <p class="infoblock__page-12__double__double-p">In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC
                                because KIC has
                                split
                                the
                                scan/copy functions into three
                                separate machines, choosing the best of breed for each. As a result, KIC offers the best
                                book
                                scanners

                                printer can be added to any KIC system, so you can optimize costs and speeds, and offer

                                performance of a typical copier. The costs are broken into three main areas: equipment

                                maintenance,

                            contour-finding laser allows it
                            to flatten even the most curved books
                            and produce text that is clear and undistorted. KIC automatically adds margins for
                            print-ready image

                            <p>Statistics from five million scanning sessions across America revealed a median session
                                length of
                                23
                                pages.
                                So, most of the time spent during a KIC session is spent scanning.
                                Face up scanning has been proven to be three times faster than face down scanning.
                                So why is speed so important</p>
                            <ul class="blue-bullet">
                                <li>It's economical. One KIC Bookeye can replace multiple copiers or other face-down

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Over the years, many libraries experimented with color copiers, but could never find a
                            formula
                            that
                            worked. If the fees were low, patrons would copy materials with so much color that the
                            library
                            would
                            spend more on ink than the fees they were collecting. If the fees were too high, the usage
                            would
                            be
                            so low that the cost of the machine couldn't be justified.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            KIC calculates the amount of color in an image before it is printed. So the fee for copies
                            with
                            a
                            little bit of color can be the same as the fee for black and white copies. If a copy has a
                            lot
                            of
                            color, the fee can be increased in proportion to the cost of the color ink or toner. This
                            wonderful
                            feature should be a simple, easy byproduct of the digital age, and it is with KIC.
