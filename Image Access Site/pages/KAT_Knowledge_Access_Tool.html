                        institution's
                        library's print collections has been a big problem that no one wants to talk about. Efforts
                        to
                        ameliorate this problem include brief mentions in freshmen orientation packets and research
                        projects
                        assigned by some faculty members, but the most common and most effective methods used to get
                        the
                        digital generation to try something different is to use lots of visuals. Just as restaurants
                        publish
                        images of their dining areas and their menu items online, with the introduction of KIC

                        The digital age has brought with it many changes, most desirable, some less so. When

                        them, that means that everything that can be digital, should be digital. It is not obvious

                        that

                        probably
