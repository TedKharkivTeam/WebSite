                    For a dozen years, this shrinking student appreciation of the immense value in their institution's
                    library's print collections has been a big problem that no one wants to talk about. Efforts to
                    ameliorate this problem include brief mentions in freshmen orientation packets and research projects
                    assigned by some faculty members, but the most common and most effective methods used to get the
                    digital generation to try something different is to use lots of visuals. Just as restaurants publish
                    images of their dining areas and their menu items online, with the introduction of KIC Stacks View,
                    libraries can now make images of their stacks and bibliographic records available visually online as
                    well.

                    The digital age has brought with it many changes, most desirable, some less so. When students enter
                    higher education, they naturally expect far greater sophistication than they experienced in high
                    school. To
                    them, that means that everything that can be digital, should be digital. It is not obvious to them
                    that
                    the great value in the vast print collections in their college libraries is in the content. They
                    probably
                    don't know that it's cost prohibitive to purchase a digital version of every print item. Their
                    appreciation of
                    the library's stacks must be built from scratch, The best starting point ... their digital world.
