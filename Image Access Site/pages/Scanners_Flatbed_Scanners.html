                <p>The WideTEK 12-600 is available for applications where A3+ is large enough but fast scanning speed
                    and high
                    optical resolution is required. The scanner needs less than three seconds to scan the largest format
                    of 12.5
                    x 18.5 inches in normal mode at 300dpi and only 12 seconds in 3D mode at 600dpi, twice as fast as
                    the
                    closest competition. It comes with a built-in 64bit Linux PC running on an Intel i3 quad core
                    processor and
                    8GB of memory.</p>
                <p>WideTEK&reg; 12 delivers high resolution color, black and white or grayscale images in jpeg, tiff,

                    compact
                    dimensions in a new class of professional but affordable scanners.</p>

        <!--<h3>A Lasting Brand in Professional Flatbed Scanner Solutions</h3>-->
        <!--<p>For over 13 years, Image Access has manufactured color flatbed scanners designed for fast scans and optimal-->
        <!--image resolution, to fit just about any application requirements.</p>-->
        <!--<p>At CeBIT 2001, Image Access presented the first prototype of a fast Scan2Net&reg; scanner.-->
        <!--Designed as a flatbed, the scanning speed was remarkable &#45;&#45; less than three seconds for a color scan of a-->
        <!--DIN A2 document at 300 dpi resolution. The WideTEK FBA2 was the first scanner to utilize the innovative-->
        <!--Scan2Net&reg; technology from Image Access, enabling the world´s first communication with a-->
        <!--scanner purely via a TCP/IP network interface. No additional hardware or interface cards, driver-->
        <!--installations and configurations were required.</p>-->
        <!--<p>By 2003, Image Access was selling the WideTEK FB-A2 worldwide and had refreshed the physical design of the-->
        <!--scanner. High resolution, color fidelity and especially superior scanning speeds helped the-->
        <!--WideTEK&reg; FB-A2 quickly become a well known product in the wide format flatbed market-->
        <!--worldwide.</p>-->
        <!--<p>In March 2008, in what was the largest product launch in the company´s history &ndash; a new generation-->
        <!--flatbed scanner was introduced, the WideTEK&reg; 25. The WideTEK&reg; 25 was,-->
        <!--and<i><b> still is the fastest self service wide format flatbed color scanner on the market</b></i>. Even-->
        <!--so, Image Access continued to perfect the design and in 2012, a completely redesigned version of the WideTEK-->
        <!--25 was released, featuring a very small footprint, 35% smaller than the previous model and many other-->
        <!--improvements.</p>-->
        <!--<p>In March 2014, Image Access introduced the WideTEK 12 &#45;&#45; the smaller brother of the WideTEK 25. Both of these-->
        <!--flatbeds now feature the new and unique 3D scanning mode, producing 3D image results so detailed that they-->
        <!--look absolutely real. This revolutionary 3D scanning mode opened many opportunities in the printing and-->
        <!--industrial inspection markets. Smaller and more compact, faster and with new LED illumination, the WideTEK-->
        <!--flatbed scanners are truly unique. </p>-->
