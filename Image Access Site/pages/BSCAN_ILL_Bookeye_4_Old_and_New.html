        <h2>Out with the Old and In with the New</h2>
        <p>The sequence above shows just how much work is required to use a face-down scanner to scan multiple pages.In
            contrast, the sequence on the left shows the relative speed and ease of face-up scanning systems that do not
            require the user to flip over the book being scanned. Once placing the book, the user simply turns pages and
            presses the scan button (or foot pedal) to scan two pages at a time</p>
        <h2>Seven Complete Configurations to Choose From</h2>
        <span>BSCAN ILL can be purchased separately or as a complete system
            with the following exceptional book digitization equipment</span>
        <h2>Three Things You Should Know About ILL Digitization Equipment</h2>
        <h2>1.SPEED</h2>
        <p>All of the systems that DLSG bundles with
            BSCAN ILL are quite fast, but our face up
            scanners are the fastest. By eliminating
            the need to flip the volume repeatedly, our
            face-up scanners are up to 5 times faster
            than the fastest face-down scanners.</p>

        <h2>2.ONGOING SUPPORT & SERVICES</h2>
        <p>Digitization for ILL and digital document de- livery are production processes. It is impor- tant that they be
            backed by a reliable vendor team, and Image Access has an unmatched service and support record.</p>

        <h2>3.CAPTURING CONTENT DEEP INTO THE BOOK FOLD</h2>
        <p>Never Fail an Article Request Again</p>
        <span>Bookeye Method</span>
        <p>Bookeyes follow the
            natural curve of the book
            when they scan. Good
            lighting is essential for
            good scanning, and
            Bookeye 4 scanners em-
            ploy two white LED light
            bars that sweep across
            the material.</p>

        <span>Click Method</span>
        <p>Click captures the left and
            right pages with two separate
            cameras positioned at ideal
            angles.
            An array of 420 individu-
            ally aimed white LED lights
            produce bright, evenly distrib-
            uted illumination from above
            and behind the scan bed,
            thus avoiding reflection.</p>

        <span>BookEdge Method</span>
        <p>The BookEdge is a
            flatbed scanner with a
            specialized feature that
            easily captures close
            into the bookfold
            without damaging
            the spine.</p>
