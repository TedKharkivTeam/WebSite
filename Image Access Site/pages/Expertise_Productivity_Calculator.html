            Tired of reading statements like "fastest scanner on the market at 6 inches/s" while other scanners scan at
            over 12 inches/s?</b></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">So are we!</h3>
        <p>That´s why Image Access developed the
            <a href="../docs/Productivity_Calculator.xlsx" target="_blank"> Productivity Calculator</a>
            , a tool designed to let you compare wide format scanners with fully configurable scenarios, giving you a
            productivity comparison based on your real life requirements &ndash; not some hypothetical best case
            statistic like "Batch scanning for one hour".</p>
        <p>Don´t fall for the unfounded claims made by scanner manufacturers. Set up your own contest between two
            scanners and see which one really offers you the highest productivity. Put statements like
            <span style="display:inline; font-style:italic; color:#d50026">"... the Professional model is the fastest wide format scanner on the market. Period."</span>
            to the test. </p>
        <p>The Productivity Calculator takes real production factors into consideration when comparing scanners. In
            order to do this, we had to collect the rated scanning speeds of each of the competing scanners from the
            manufacturer´s product literature. The results of this task are shown in the bar chart "Rated Scanning
            Speeds".</p>
        <p>But, comparing rated scanning speeds is only one part of the equation. Add to that the time it takes to pick
            up the source document, feed it into the scanner, wait for the scan and any processing pauses and finally
            take the document out of the output tray or replace it for the next scan. The Productivity Calculator allows
            the user to compare source document sizes from one scanner to another &ndash; even if you want to compare
            two different sizes.</p>
