        <strong class="OAI">OAI</strong>
        <p class="OAI2">Opus support for the Open Archive Initiative (OAI) takes
            on several forms. Opus has the ability to generate export derivative sets
            which can be added into an OAI-compliant metadata repository and made available
            via the OAI-PMH to any OAI compliant metadata harvesters. The DLSG operates
            and manages the cloud infrastructure necessary to support this need, thus
            freeing our users from having to acquire and maintain the expertise to
            make their chosen objects available to the digital archive community at large.
            For example, this feature of Opus allows its users to easily contribute to the
            Digital Public Library Project (DPLA) with just a few clicks.</p>
        <p class="OAI3">
            The underlying object resources (images) described in the OAI-compliant
            metadata export may either be hosted by the OPUS customers themselves or the
            resources can be uploaded to a DLSG-maintained archive repository as part of the OAI publishing process.
        </p>
        <p class="OAI4">Published objects can be further queried and made available
            by Opus's support for the OAI-ORE project. In addition to the cloud based OAI
            publishing features, the DLSG cloud repository allows the user community of
            Opus Systems to share or exchange Opus objects among themselves.</p>
        <p class="metadata_capture">Opus Hierarchical Metadata Capture</p>
        <p class="OAI5">Opus' hierarchical metadata capture is controlled by templates that can be created
            and modified to fit virtually any requirements. Input field characteristics include
            :required/optional, repeatable/one occurrence only and other characteristicsc
            that can be specified when templates are constructed of modified. Opus provides several
            generic templates to capture the data necessary to create virtual library output formats.</p>
        <p class="OAI6">Opus provides a straightforward graphical interface for
            creating and modifying hierarchical templates. The templates carry the charasterics
            of XML elements and attributes. Data entry rules such as required/optional and
            single/multiple can be assigned to each field. During metadata capture and entry,
            Opus enforces the rules, thus simplifying metadata entry and reducing errors.</p>
        <img class="table1_freeflow" src="../images/Opus_Free_Flow/table1.png"/>
        <p class="OAI7">In addition, the Opus hierarchical metadata input facility allows
            users to scroll back and forth through the images of an object (e.g. pages of
            a book ) while reviewing and entering metadata.</p>
        <img class="table2_freeflow" src="../images/Opus_Free_Flow/table2.png"/>
        <p class="OAI8">One of the key benefits of the Opus Metadata capture system
            is its flexibility in allowing project curators to not only design and codify
            their own specialized metadata data capture needs, but to link these metadata collection
            sets to customized object meronomies. This degree of metadata capture
            task standardization affords the project's curator the confidence to
            know that their project's metadata needs will be meet by the data collection4
            team.</p>
        <p class="OAI9">Once these completed metadata collection templates have
            been defined , they can be shared back into curator's community,
            thus allowing the project to expand beyond a single institute. This ensures
            that the resultant aggregate of objects can be blended seamlessly together
            into a single master archive to be used by the project's curators to
            publish their collective work as part of a single repository.</p>
