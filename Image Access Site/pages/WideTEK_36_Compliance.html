        <h2>WideTEK&reg; 36 Compliance</h2>
        <p>Image Access scanners are environmentally friendly, comply to the highest security standards and do not
            interfere with other devices. By constructive measures Image Access ensures that no harmful radiation in the
            form of electromagnetic emission and UV or infrared light exists. Because these kinds of scanners are heavy
            production machines with inherent risks to the operator, no one should operate a scanner from a vendor who
            cannot provide at least an IEC/UL 60950 or an IEC/EN 62368 safety report. </p>
        <p>.Image Access scanners conform to many national and international standards which are listed below. Our
            scanners have been tested and certified by independent laboratories. Reports of these tests are available
            upon request.</p>
        <p>
            <b>The WideTEK&reg; 36 conforms to the following standards:</b>
