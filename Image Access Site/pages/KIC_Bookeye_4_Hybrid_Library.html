        <h2>The Hybrid Library</h2>
        <p>To fully earn the 'hybrid library' designation, a library's existing print collections must be available in
            digital format. KIC systems allow your students and faculty to select material for quick and easy self-serve
            digiti- zation, providing a valuable conduit between your print collections and patron tablets, PCs,
            eReaders
            and smart devices.</p>
        <p>KIC's self-serve digitize-on-demand capabilities leverage your library's most valuable assets &ndash; its
            print
            collections. Digital images don't have the limitations of physical copies. They can instantly be shared with
            fellow researchers around the world via email or Cloud, dramatically facilitating collaboration. KIC avoids
            the
            digital rights management conundrum.</p>
        <p>Each digitization is for a single use, but thousands of patrons can digi- tize content from the same book,
            yet
            preserve the book's spine.</p>
        <h2>Resource Sharing</h2>
        <p>We know the importance of resource sharing.
            To help squeeze more value out of your investment, KIC can be configured to support the BSCAN Interlibrary
            Loan
            system, the Opus Digitiza- tion Workflow system, and general ad hoc scanning. Use a USB flash drive to
            enable
            other types of scanning at a KIC station and temporarily access shared folders on a network.
            When you unplug the USB, the KIC station automatically returns to its regular self-serve scanning station
            functionality. For general purpose scanning by ad- ministrators and faculty, simply write a department
            password
            file to a flash drive. When a user plugs in the USB 'key', KIC recognizes the password and allows the user
            to
            save scanned images to shared folders.</p>
        <h2>Premium Maintenance Plan</h2>
        <p>Image Access has an unmatched service and support record. It is impossible to affordably provide service
            personnel living in every city and town across America that are highly trained on the very special
            technologies
            needed by libraries.
            Instead, DLSG designs remote serviceability into its products and has perfected remote diagnosis and when
            possible, repair.
            The resulting savings allows DLSG to frequently and promptly provide loaner/swap-out equipment and to go on
            site
            whenever necessary to maintain and repair equipment, minimizing interruptions in service for your
            patrons.</p>
