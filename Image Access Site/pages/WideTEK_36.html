        <h2>WideTEK&reg; 36 &ndash; Quiet &amp; compact wide format color scanner for documents up to 36 inch
            widths</h2>
        <div class="example zoom36"></div>

        <p>WideTEK&reg; 36 scans documents up to 36 inches wide (915mm). It is quiet and compact, making it
            ideal for applications in any office or production environment.It is the fastest high end color scanner with
            three CCD cameras.</p>
        <p>State of the art illumination using bright white LEDs guarantees long lifetime and a low cost of ownership,
            since there are practically no consumables necessary over the life of the product. Cutting edge camera
            technology, with a dust-protected, fully sealed camera box holding CCD systems that use a patented stitching
            procedure, delivers up to 1200 dpi scanner resolution.</p>
        <h3>Easy to use walk up scanning or mobile scanning with Scan2PAD&reg;</h3>
        <p>The integrated walk up scanning software makes the scanner a truly shared device. One click of the mouse is
            enough to either print the scan, send it to any directory in the network or via email, to upload it to the
            FTP server, or to save it to the USB memory device. Simply walk up, scan and store or send the image, all
            through the use of the touchscreen.</p>
        <p><b>Scan2Pad&reg;</b> lets you control the WideTEK 36 using an iPad or an Android tablet or even a
            smartphone running Android version 4.0.3 or higher. Quickly adjust the color depth, go from black &amp;
            white to grayscale or full color and adjust brightness and contrast on your pad. Create PDF documents from
            your scans in a single step. Scan2PAD is the unique mobile scanning application that doesnÂ´t require you to
            use an external cloud server. Simply scan your documents and take them away on your pad. It is fast, secure
            and best of all, free of charge.</p>
        <h3>Gentle Scanning of Historical and Fragile Documents</h3>
        <p>WideTEK&reg; 36 gently scans due to special transport rollers that serve as pressure points
            ensuring safe document transport. For historical and fragile documents, this is critical.</p>
        <p>Automatic document size recognition means that operators are flexible when feeding a source document into the
            scanner. It is not necessary to exactly center the document on the scan area. With crop and deskew, the
            resulting image output will be straight, centered and without black borders.</p>
        <p>The new and unique background drum does not touch the glass plate at any time, avoiding scratches and
            document skews. To achieve extra contrast on sepias and film based documents, the standard black drum can be
            exchanged with a white drum, without needing any tools. </p>
        <p>The user operates the scanner either with a standard internet browser or alternatively, via the built-in
            touchscreen. A monitor directly connected to the scanner can be used for image control or to modify the scan
            parameters, without a client PC. Using the touchscreen display, up to 30 different password protected jobs
            can be defined and stored. The jobs contain preconfigured settings such as scan parameters or directories on
            the network drives.</p>
        <p>The exceptionally high scanning speed, dust-protected and encapsulated optical components and the absence of
            consumables characterize this highly efficient production-ready device. With a life expectancy of over one
            million scans, the WideTEK&reg; 36 redefines the price/performance ratio in the wide format
            scanner market.</p>
