        <p><b>If you are ready to purchase a scanner and are looking around at what various vendors have to offer, don´t be
            fooled by what may seem to be a remarkably low price tag. Often vendors quote you only the bottom line price
            of the scanner itself but leave out the additional costs of hardware (PCs, floor stands, paper baskets),
            software and accessories which are required to operate the scanner properly. Costs incurring later in the
            life of a scanner for consumables and spare parts are almost never a part of the sales discussion. All of
            these costs together make up the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of a scanner and should be considered before
            making a purchasing decision.</b></p>
        <p>Image Access has developed a new TCO calculator, now available free of charge, to help you calculate various
            total costs of ownership scenarios. It also includes different models from main competitors and computes the
            real cost per year, depending on various usage patterns. The calculator uses published US$ list prices and
            is very flexible yet simple to use.</p>
        <p>Click on the magnifying glass in the graphic to your left and you will see an enlarged version of the first
            page, summarizing the initial cost of the purchase. Our WideTEK 36C starts at $ 7,990 or € 5.990 but already
            includes software and PC. The competitor&amp;acute;s offer on the right side of the Excel sheet seems lower
            at first glance but if you factor in the necessary software and the PC required to operate it, you will see
            that even the TCO of the initial purchase is 12% higher than our WideTEK 36C.</p>
        <p>In order to lower the total cost of ownership of an Image Access scanner, we offer an all-encompassing
            Extended Warranty Program for the first years of a scanner´s life and up to five years. The ExtendedWarranty
            Program guarantees all parts free of charge. This offer applies to any WideTEK or Bookeye scannerif used at
            a rate of up to 10,000 scans per month. Image Access´ new Extended Warranty Program ensures a protected
            investment at no additional cost.
            <a href="../docs/IACExtendedWarrantyProgram.pdf" target="_blank">
                You can read more about the Extended Warranty Program here.</a></p>
        <p>Competitors have similar warranty programs and offerings but they all exclude glass plates, lamps, transport
            and pressure rollers or other consumables. This means that the total cost of ownership for the scanner over
            its lifetime is considerably higher than the purchase price, when taking the cost of all spare parts into
            consideration. What might look like a low initial price tag can be deceiving. Replacement parts and
            consumables increase the total cost of ownership significantly.</p>

            another.</p>
