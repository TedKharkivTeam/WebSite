        <h2>WideTEK<sup>&reg;</sup> 36DS Compliance</h2>

        <p>Image Access scanners are environmentally friendly, comply to the highest security standards and do not
            interfere with other devices.
            We have also made sure that no harmful radiation in the form of electromagnetic emission and UV or infrared
            light exists.
            Because these kinds of scanners are heavy production machines with inherent risks to the operator,
            no one should operate a scanner from a vendor who cannot provide at least an IEC/UL 60950 safety
            report. </p>
        <p>Image Access scanners conform to the many national and international standards which are listed below.
            Our scanners have been tested and certified by independent laboratories and we can also provide test reports
            of each standard on paper upon request. </p>
        <p><b>The WideTEK<sup>&reg;</sup> 36DS conforms to the following standards:</b></p>

                    The China Compulsory Certificate (CCC mark) is a compulsory safety mark for a wide range of products
                    imported and sold in the Chinese market.
                    It became effective on August 1, 2003, when China became a member of the WTO (World Trade
                    Organisation).
                    The CCC mark is required for both Chinese manufactured and foreign imported merchandise.
                    The CCC certificate must be renewed annually as part of a follow-up certification which includes a
