        <h2>WideTEK&reg; 25-600 Wide Format Flatbed for All Markets</h2>
        <div class="example zoom25"></div>

        <h3>Large format color flatbed scanner for documents up to 18.5 x 25" <br>Enhanced with backlight for
            transparent source material, like X-rays</h3>
        <p>WideTEK&reg; 25-600, the world´s fastest large format color flatbed, covers applications in every
            market, whether it is in the medical, government, industrial or graphics arts sector. It scans the full bed
            (DINA2+, 18.5x25".) at 300dpi color in less than three seconds, which is two times faster than the closest
            competition.</p>
        <h3>Backlight Unit for X-rays, film, negatives and more</h3>
        <p><span class="new">New!</span> The WideTEK&reg; 25-600 brings you an even higher return on
            investment with the addition of the
            <a href="../docs/Prospekt_WT25-600Backlight_en.pdf" title="Download the product brochure." target="_blank">new
                WT25-BACKLIGHT option</a>
            for scanning transparent material of all kinds, like X-rays, glass negatives, 35mm microfilm aperture cards,
            cutout stencils, sepias and film.</p>
        <img src="../images/WideTEK_25/WT25_Backlight_Samples.png"><br>
        <h6><i>Above is an example of the various media scanned with the backlight unit. The scans are at the top and
            the source material below.</i></h6>
        <p>The optional backlight unit replaces the standard scanner lid. It is easily assembled and users can scan with
            or without the backlight, depending on the source material requirements, by simply switching the light on or
            off. The unit can be purchased separately for customers who already own a WideTEK 25-600. If you are a
            service provider, this gives you even more ways to generate revenues with your WideTEK 25.</p>
        <p>In the medical sector, operators can scan negatives, radiography, cardio plaques and larger paper documents
            in black and white, color or grayscale as required. The WideTEK 25 is compact, only (76cm, 30") wide, so it
            will fit in any doctor´s office or hospital floor.</p>
        <p>There are many film scanners available on the market for small image formats and even medium sized images,
            but in the large format range, film scanners are very rare and/or prohibitively expensive. <b>WideTEK 25-600
                goes far beyond just film scanning and does it an a surprisingly affordable price.</b></p>
        <p>Municipalities, cadastral offices, oil companies, GIS services and other government agencies use the WideTEK
            25-600 to digitize and archive a number of different types of documents. But the WideTEK 25 is also ideal
            for photographers, galleries, advertising agencies and graphic artists to present and preserve their work in
            a digital format. </p>
        <h3>2D and 3D scanning</h3>
        <img src="../images/WideTEK_25/2D3DScanning.png" style="float:left; width:380px; margin:2px;">
        <p>The revolutionary 3D scanning mode opens many new opportunities in the printing and industrial inspection
            markets. The 3D scanning mode captures the texture of surfaces so perfectly that the scan on a screen looks
            like the real thing.</p>
        <p>The WideTEK 25-600 has two LED lamps, twice as many as the competition. With their new diffusors, these lamps
            produce an extremely homogeneous illumination which eliminates all unwanted shadows caused by folds,
            wrinkles and other distortions of the scanned object. It also comes with a built-in 64bit Linux PC running
            on an Intel i3 quad core processor and 8GB of memory.</p>
        <p>Simply put, there is <b>no better large format flatbed scanner on the market </b>than the WideTEK 25-600,
            with or without the optional backlight unit. </p>
