        <!--<h2>True 2 Touch TM User Interface</h2>-->
        <!--<p>Ease-of-use is a central feature of KIC. Its large, 22 inch touch screen and its large "Scan" and "Save, Send-->
            <!--or Print" buttons that occupy a very large portion of the touch screen clearly convey how easy KIC is to-->
            <!--use. The Save button defaults to an output method and file format that is selectable by the institution. If-->
            <!--a flash drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it will save to-->
            <!--the flash drive. Users can override the default output method by manually selecting one or more other-->
            <!--methods of output.<br><br></p>-->
        <!--<p>KIC Bookeye 4's high speed is derived as much from its ultra-simple, true two-touch interface as from its-->
            <!--face-up design that obviates the need to flip books over and over again during the capture process. The-->
            <!--tabletop model KIC Bookeye 4 has all the True2Touch capabilities of the full-size KIC. It has its own-->
            <!--tabletop version of the SmartDock, and of course, an ADF scanner can be placed anywhere on the table. ADA-->
            <!--compliance is achieved by purchasing a table with a 30 inch clearance to the floor and a 31 inch height. KIC-->
            <!--Bookeye 4's elegant design puts the full KIC self-serve digitization functionality into a compact and-->
            <!--appealing space. Its 17" touch screen and large preview screen and capture surface are at the perfect height-->
            <!--for wheelchair-->
            <!--access. The KIC Bookeye 4 also offers an optional desktop configuration with a single 22" touch/preview-->

        <!--<h2>KIC's True2Touch TM User Interface, Especially Forgiving for Beginners</h2><br><br>-->
        <!--<ul>-->
            <!--<li>KIC is very agile, and allows the user to jump from just about anywhere in the touch screen system to-->
                <!--just about anywhere else, directly and usually with a single touch.-->
                <!--This modern, 'modeless' design is easier to use, but difficult to create.-->
            <!--</li>-->
            <!--<li>KIC's large buttons and controls are easy to use, even for people with unsteady hands.</li>-->
            <!--<li>KIC gradually expands and contracts controls such as brightness, con- trast and DPI so users can easliy-->
                <!--follow their screen activity.-->
            <!--</li>-->
            <!--<li>KIC doesn't delete original images when you clip a photo or excerpt of text unless you tell it to.</li>-->
            <!--<li>KIC lets you output to many different destinations in a single session.-->
                <!--Once you've scanned a document, you can change your mind as to where you would like it to output. For-->
                <!--example, you may have wanted to save to USB, but learned your USB drive is full.-->
                <!--Or you may scan so much that it exceeds your email limit. Or after scanning and collating a mass of-->
                <!--research, you decide that you want to share the research with others.-->
            <!--</li>-->
        <!--</ul>-->
        <!--<h2>Two Large Screens for Simplicity & Power</h2>-->
        <!--<p>It's easy to undervalue screen size. For 20 years, all cellphone makers relent- lessly pursued smaller and-->
            <!--smaller screens until very recently when one com- pany reversed that trend. They realized that people want-->
            <!--the largest screen that will fit in their pocket/purse and hand. This is because display screens are our-->
            <!--window to the digital world, and touch screens give us control over that world. As big as self-serve-->
            <!--scanning systems are, it makes sense to have a very large touch screen. And with the low prices for high-->
            <!--quality displays, it is compelling to add a separate display screen. In 2002, DLSG realized this, when the-->
            <!--first KIC system was designed. Today, with nearly 10 years more experience than any other vendor, DLSG has-->
            <!--the most understandable, easy to use and powerful user interface for self-serve book scanning, and it's-->
            <!--based on dual screens. The view screen shows very large, clear images of what you've scanned, allow- ing the-->
            <!--touch screen to have big, easy to understand buttons and other controls. Display screens are our portals-->
            <!--into the digital world, and touch screens are the easiest way to control that world. That's why DLSG-->
            <!--provides large, 24 inch, full HD displays and equally large touch screens with most of its KIC systems.</p>-->
