        <h2>Bookeye&reg; 4 V3</h2>
        <div class="example zoom4v3"></div>
        <p>With this new member of the Bookeye&reg; family, Image Access placed an emphasis on developing a scanner
            which is compact, easy to operate and competitively priced; to bring high end professional scanning to an
            even larger population of users. The efficient Bookeye&reg; 4 V3 digitizes source material such as bound
            documents at high speeds in up to 400 dpi optical resolution and formats up to DIN A3.</p>
        <p>Over 17 years of electronic, optical and mechanical engineering experience went into the creation and
            manufacture of the Bookeye&reg; 4 models. The clever mirror mechanism captures the document precisely from
            edge to edge, whether it is a flat document or a book open at an angle of 120 degrees.</p>
        <p>The V-shaped book cradle was optimized to reduce the risk of damage to book spines and binding during
            digitization. The book cradle holds the open book at an angle of 120 degrees; enough to effectively scan the
            contents of a page, while gently preserving the original subject matter.</p>
        <h2>Book scanning made easy</h2>
        <p>Bookeye&reg; 4 V3 has all the advantages of a more expensive standalone device. Outfitted with an integrated
            color touchscreen and monitor, Bookeye&reg; 4 V3 can reach unrivaled scanning speeds and process large
            volumes of data independent of any external peripheral devices &ndash; a typical feature of all Image Access
            scanners.</p>
        <p>It takes approximately 1.1 seconds for the Bookeye&reg; 4 V3 to capture and process the images of two pages
            of a DIN A3 sized book scanned at 200 dpi optical resolution. Once the image is on the screen, modifications
            can be made to scan parameters such as brightness, color or contrast without having to rescan. Users operate
            the system intuitively, guided by clear and well structured menu commands on the touchscreen. Scanned images
            can be saved to a USB flash drive, sent via email, printed on a connected or network printer, or uploaded to
            an FTP Server or Cloud.</p>
        <p>Bookeye&reg; 4 V3's solid build, innovative features and competitive pricing make it an ideal book copier for
            large groups of users; for example, in a university library. Some of the advantages of using a Bookeye&reg;
            4 instead of a standard copier include the Bookeye&reg;'s built-in book cradle for gently handling bound
            materials, its speed and simplicity of operation, and the fact that the resulting digital images
            substantially reduce, and in most cases eliminate, the need to print scanned material.</p>
