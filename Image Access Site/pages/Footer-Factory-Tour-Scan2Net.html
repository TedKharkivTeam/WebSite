        <h3 class="blue-label-2net">Better than just another client software package <br>
            Integrates into existing networks without additional drivers or PCs<br>
            Unrivalled performance, highest security, low connectivity cost</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The Scan2Net platform is the technological foundation of all WideTEK and
            Bookeye scanners from Image Access. It replaces the proprietary scanner drivers and software
            that traditional scanners require with the fastest common, non proprietary connection available: TCP/IP over
            Ethernet. With network interface speeds much higher than USB or SCSI, Scan2Net devices are able to reach
            unrivaled performance at very low connectivity cost. The Linux based operating system is dedicated to
            scanner specific imaging and mechanical control tasks, further maximizing scanning speeds and
            performance.</p>
