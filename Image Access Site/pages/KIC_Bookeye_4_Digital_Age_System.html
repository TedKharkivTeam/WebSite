        <h2>A True Digital Age Multifunction System for Academic & Public Libraries</h2>
        <h3>Book Scanning</h3>
        <p>Students at academic libraries want speed, and DLSG offers the fastest book scanners on the market. Patrons
            at
            public libraries need simplicity, and KIC provides three of the simplest possible user interfaces, one
            exclusively for scanning, one exclusively for copying and one exclusively for faxing.
            And KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.</p>
        <br><img src="../images/Dlsg/KIC/Click_Page2_Scan.png" width="429" height="246">
        <h3>Copier Replacement</h3>
        <p>While multifunction copiers are partly digital, they are big mechanical machines with big maintenance issues
            and
            tiny touch screens. As a copier replacement, KIC eliminates copier failure/service problems and provides
            very
            large touch screens and view screens that are larger still.
            Organizing (collating, clipping, rotating, etc.) pages on a huge touch screen is much easier than shuffling
            paper.</p>
        <p>The digital age has steadily driven down the demand in libraries for paper copies to levels that make it
            increasingly difficult to justify copiers. KIC self-service scanning systems reduce copier use
            further &ndash;
            to the point that attaching a small laser or ink jet printer is sufficient.</p>
        <p>KIC systems also handle much larger materials than copiers, and they scan books without damaging them.
            However,
            the most compelling benefit of KIC over copiers is KIC's speed, due mainly to its face-up scanning design,
            which
            is not only significantly faster, but far easier to use.</p>

        <h3>Self-Serve Fax</h3>
        <p>KIC's huge touch screen and larger view screen make faxing extra easy. Users can compose, review, clip, crop
            and
            change brightness and contrast of the pages of a fax before sending.</p>
        <p>KIC's step-by-step process is designed for easy operation by even the most timid users.
            All you need is an internet connection, and DLSG will provide the rest at a cost so low that fax revenue can
            pay
            for the KIC system in a few years or less.</p>

        <h3>KIC Coins</h3>
        <p>Printing copies and faxing have per page costs that normally must be passed on to the user.
            KIC has a free, built-in method of charging users for copies and faxes.
            Simply print wallet-size "KIC Coins" on regular letter-sized paper in any denomination that you like, cut
            them
            out, and sell them to users at the circulation desk or wherever you collect fees for late book returns.</p>

        <h3>KIC Compatible with Copy Card & Cash Systems</h3>
        <p>All KIC systems are compatible with all standard copy card and coin-op devices.
            Since KIC transfers images to users' computers electronically, costly expendables are avoided, even for
            color!
            The library can opt to keep all revenue it collects.</p>
