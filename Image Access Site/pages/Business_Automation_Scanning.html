                    <span class="title">Control Sheets</span>
                    BSCAN control sheets allow users to select the scanning application, the scanner settings,
                    image processing, document separation and auto-indexing. While these settings can be made
                    by the scan operator, the control sheet allow the scanner operator to focus on maximizing throughput
                    and quality. Hours of document preparation can be quickly reviewed before scanning to eliminate errors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img id="white-pages" src="../images/Business_Automation_Scanning/WhitePages.png" alt="" />
                    When they can be used, the barcodes on the control sheets are the most efficient
                    and accurate way to index the images scanned. For example, with backfile con-
                    versions, basic information about each file folder is usually in a database. By creating
                    a list file of that basic information, sorted in the order the folders are stored in the
                    cabinets, BSCAN can print a control sheet for each folder that will automatically
                    index that folder if it is placed at the start of the start of the document pages in the folder.
                    During document preparation, the next page in the stack of folder control sheets
                    should always match the folder pulled from the cabinet to be prepared for scanning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, while scanning or as post-process, the scan station can perform image
                    processing functions such as Rotation, Crop & Deskew, Despeckle, Border
                    Removal, Blank Page Deletion and Color Dropout.
                </p>
                <div class="indent">
                    <span class="heading">Application Selection Control Sheet</span>
                    <p>
                        Place application selection control sheets on top of each batch of pages to be
                        scanned to ensure that documents are not scanned into the wrong application.
                    </p>
                    <span class="heading">General Purpose Control Sheet</span>
                    <p>
                        Set scanner parameters, select image format, turn image processing such as
                        rotation on and off, identify the start of new documents and folders and attach
                        database records to the pages following these general purpose control sheets. They also
                        contain a 10 digit mark sense field for specifying field values during document preparation.
                    </p>
                    <span class="heading">Document Type Control Sheet</span>
                    <p>
                        Use these control sheet to separate documents and identify document type. Print control sheet with all common document types and
                        BSCAN will apply the text or code of the marked document type to the document following the control sheet. By including a special type:
                        <span class="heading">[] Other</span> and space for hand printing the document code and name, only the most common document separator sheets need be printed,
                        reducing the number of control sheet bins for the various document types.

                <p>
                    <span class="title">Image Processing</span>
                    Image Processing can be performed on each image as it is scanned or after scanning. In addition to the usual  image
                    processing functions such as rotate, crop and deskew, despeckle and border removal, tests can be enabled that automatically check for signs of
                    bad images such as text dropout and a high degree of skew. Images are automatically flagged for review and reprocessing without a scanner or
                    when necessary, for rescanning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="title">Rescan</span>
                    During QC, if it is determined that rescanning is needed, such as when a page was scanned with the corner folder, rhe image can be
                    flagged for rescan. During the Rescan stage, each flagged image is presented for rescan with information displayed to help locate the original page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="title">Forms Processing</span>
                    OCR, Barcode Recognition, ICR and Mark Sense are performed here to automatically recognize and extract data from
                    forms. The captured data is then populated into user specified fields for review/correction. High speed correction of suspect characters can be
                    performed to improve accuracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="title">Key Entry</span>
                    Key entry can be performed on a separate BSCAN-DE station or on the BSCAN scan station with extra licensing. Key-key verify
                    and auto-zoom by field are some of BSCAN's many data entry capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="title">Review and Correct</span>
                    At this stage captured data can be reviewed and corrected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="title">Release</span>
                    After scanning, cleanup and indexing, BSCAN can release images and index information to third-party imaging software, directly to SQL
                    server, to a directory structure or to an ASCII file. BSCAN Standard can create a selection of PDF file formats while scanning.

                        complex workflow system with unlimited stations is a snap. Select from a list of
                        sample capture workflow templates or build several of your own. The Wizard
                        will walk you through a step-by-step configuration process. Conversion
                        bureaus can build their own special tricks into BSCAN applications and install
                        them as workflow templates that can used to set up new projects.
