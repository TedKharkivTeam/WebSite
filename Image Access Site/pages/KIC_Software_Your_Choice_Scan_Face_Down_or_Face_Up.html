            <p class="dvfu3">Face-up book scanning is far easier on both
                patrons and books and quite a bit faster than face-down scanning.</p>

            <p>Scanning books face-up makes it much easier to keep track
                of what pages you've scanned.With KIC Click, Click Mini and other face-up scanners,
                books stay face up, so you can see what you're scanning as
                you scan it. This extra visibility eliminates the age old problem
                of skipping pages and scanning pages out of order which can occur
                with face-down scanners.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="dv_block1">
            <p>The following photo sequences show the reason that face-down scanning
                system are typically 1/3 the speed of face-up systems. The book flipping
                necessary to scan a book on a face-down scanner like the KIC BookEdge
                is shown in the photo sequence below. It's a workout both for the book
                and the patron.</p>

            <p>The ergonomic design of the face-up scanning systems
                involves only the basic movement required to set a book down and turn a page.</p>

                <p>The sequence above shows just how much work is required
                    to use a face-down scanner to scan multiple pages.

                <p>In contrast, the sequence on the left shows the relative
                    speed and ease of face-up scanning systems that do not
                    require the user to ﬂip over the book being scanned. Once
                    placing the book, the user simply turns pages and presses
                    the scan button (or foot pedal) to scan two pages at a time.</p>

                remotely. To better serve your patrons,
                it is important to know which KIC systems are
                used the most and at what times during the
                day and week, and which are used the least.
                All usage statistics can help you to determine
                the best KIC configuration for each site. And
                to make it easier to navigate from KIC to KIC
                system, KIC Fleet Manager allows you to select
                a particular KIC system via either of two
                methods: a map or a list. </p>

                With over ten years serving libraries, KIC is the most stable
                product available today. However, DLSG engineers incessantly
                work to improve KIC and support the growing changing
                digital world. DLSG offers improved software regularly, and
                in order to make it easier to deploy updates, KIC Fleet Manager
                lets you update KIC systems remotely. For example, a
                recently released feature lets you turn KIC systems on and
                off on demand or on a schedule set by a central control panel.
