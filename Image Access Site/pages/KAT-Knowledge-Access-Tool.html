                        the
                        digital generation to try something different is to use lots of visuals. Just as restaurants
                        publish
                        images of their dining areas and their menu items online, with the introduction of KIC

                        The main argument against culling/moving books off-site is the unknown, but potentially great
                        value
                        that your unabridged collection can have in inciting the very uncommon, but equally special
                        epiphany
                        that a researcher can have while browsing the stacks and perusing the very books that are
                        targeted
                        for culling. The current head of the IMF in Beijing and professor of economics at Harvard

                        If your need to repurpose a lot of stacks space outweighs the value of keeping your full
                        collection
                        browsable, then before you proceed with the culling, let DLSG photograph your entire collection
                        as
                        it is today and make it browsable with KAT stacks view. Students abd researchers can browse your
                        complete collection virtually, instantly see any book's bibliography by touching its spine, and
                        with
                        another touch, read books that have been digitized.
