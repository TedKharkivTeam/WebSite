        <h2 class="infoblock__scanners-header-h2">WideTEK<sup>&reg;</sup> 12-600 A3+ Sized Flatbed Scanner</h2>
        <div class="example zoom12"></div>
        <p class="infoblock__scanners-p">The WideTEK 12-600 is available for applications where A3+ is large enough but fast scanning speed and high
            optical resolution is required. The scanner needs less than three seconds to scan the largest format of 12.5
            x 18.5 inches in normal mode at 300dpi and only 12 seconds in 3D mode at 600dpi, twice as fast as the
            closest competition. It comes with a built-in 64bit Linux PC running on an Intel i3 quad core processor and
            8GB of memory.</p>
        <p class="infoblock__scanners-p">WideTEK 12 delivers high resolution color, black and white or grayscale images in jpeg, tiff,
            pdf and most other standard image output formats. It combines production ready design and uniquely compact
            dimensions in a new class of professional but affordable scanners.</p>
        <h3 class="infoblock__scanners-header-h3">Big Features with a Tiny Footprint</h3>
        <p class="infoblock__scanners-p">The WideTEK12-600 is only 17.4 inches (44cm) wide, slightly more than its scanning area. Although it has a
            tiny footprint, it still scans 19% more surface area than DIN/ISO A3 but is small enough to fit on any
            desktop.</p>
        <img src="../images/WideTEK_12/2D3DScanning.png" style="float:right; width:350px; margin:5px;">
        <p class="infoblock__scanners-p">WideTEK 12 and WideTEK 25 are the only wide format flatbed scanners which also capture 3D
            surfaces in a quality suitable for inspection and quality control but compact enough for your desktop. The
            3D scanning mode opens many new opportunities in the web presentation, printing and industrial inspection
            markets by capturing the texture of surfaces so perfectly that the scan on a screen looks like the real
            object.</p>
        <p class="infoblock__scanners-p">The WideTEK 12-600 utilizes two LED lamps, twice as many as the competition. With the diffusors, these lamps
            produce an extremely homogeneous illumination which eliminates all unwanted shadows caused by folds,
            wrinkles and other distortions of the scanned object.</p>
        <p class="infoblock__scanners-p">The scanner can be operated with the lid down if wrinkled or thin documents are scanned but it also works
            with the lid open. Automatic crop &amp; deskew works perfectly in both directions, eliminating the
            cumbersome need of other scanners to align documents to any edges or markers.</p>
        <p class="infoblock__scanners-p">Working with the WideTEK 12 is simple &ndash; either with a standard web browser, the built in touchscreen or
            a mobile device like an iPad or Android tablet,
            using our application for mobile devices Scan2Pad&reg;.</p>
