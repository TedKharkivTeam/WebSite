            <h3>Scan2Net&reg; Technology as the Basis of the Bookeye&reg Book Scanner</h3>
            <p>The Scan2Net&reg technological platform forms the basis of all Bookeye&reg
                <b>book scanners</b> and WideTEK&reg large format scanners. Scan2Net&reg
                eliminates the need for proprietary drivers and interface cards and uses what is currently fastest,
                open connection to PC-based systems: TCP / IP over Ethernet.</p>

                the firmware kernel on all Image Access scanners- is compatible with operating systems such as Windows,
                Linux, Mac OS, Unix and all Web browsers like Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome and Firefox.</p>
            <p>The numerous new features of HTML5 markup language, which is already implemented in most browsers,
                further
                extend the capabilities of the scanners.</p>
            <p>A 64 bit Linux-based, virus protected operating system enables faster internal processing of the image
                data
                and optimizes the scanning process.</p>
            <p>The latest generation of Intel processors make Scan2Net devices highly energy efficient.
                Thanks to the 4 GB of RAM, very large volumes of data can be processed at remarkable speeds and
                virtually
                unlimited job sizes are possible.</p>

            <h3>Bookeye&reg - A Book Scanner Success Story for Over 18 Years</h3>
            <p>The Bookeye&reg brand of overhead <b>book scanners</b>
                from Image Access has been a synonym worldwide for gentle and protective digitization of bound and
                stapled
                documents in large and smaller formats over the past 18 years. </p>
            <p>The first generation of Bookeye&reg book scanners was developed in 1995, a grayscale system for
                documents up to A3 format.
                A year later, you could already scan documents in the A2+ format. </p>
            <p>This was followed by the models Bookeye&reg 2 and Bookeye&reg 2 plus, which were
                built between 2000 and 2011.
                The Bookeye&reg 2 was the first color book scanner from Image Access and with over 2,500
                successful installations around the globe. </p>

                 alt="Bookeye&reg 2plus - Book Scanners for Libraries and Archives" width="180" height="186"/>
            <p>Bookeye&reg 2 was available in various different versions: up to A1+ size, with reproduction
                lighting, automatic book cradle and glass plate,
                depending on the requirements the customer had. From the beginning, all Bookeye&reg 2 book
                scanners had low emission lamps. </p>
            <p>Eight years of experience with Bookeye&reg 1 and Bookeye&reg
                2 in library and archive environments and the rapidly growing installation base, a third
                Bookeye&reg
                book scanner was developed in 2004. With this system, Image Access addressed the ever increasing demands
                from the market to satisfy
                requirements for mass digitization projects, which depend on stability, productivity and high image
                quality.
                The Bookeye&reg
                3 family of book scanners was born - digitizing documents up to A1+ in size and with 600 dpi optical
                resolution, distinguished by an integrated,
                automatic book cradle with an optional glass plate and a completely revised illumination system which
                featured UV- and IR-free LED lamps. </p>

                 alt="Bookeye&reg 3 - Ideal book scanner for gentle scanning" width="180" height="166"/>
            <p>Customers appreciated the universal applicability of the Bookeye&reg 3 and the excellent quality
                of the scan results.
                A perfect example of the unique and universal qualities of the the Bookeye&reg
                3 was the implementation of over 90 Bookeye&reg 3 book scanners in the Japanese Parliamentary
                Library,
                in which not only the highest quality scanning results were required but also that the book scanners are
                tough enough to withstand 24/7 operation. </p>

            <p>At CeBIT 2010, the Bookeye&reg 4 product family was launched.
                Once again, all the experience and requirements of what had grown to over 4,000 installations were
                compiled
                and implemented
                into a completely new book scanner concept. The attributes that set Bookeye apart from other book
                scanners
                on the market remained -
                - high productivity and top quality of the scanner, scanning documents up to A1+ at 600 optical dpi and
                a
                level of usability so simple that it
                could be implemented as a self service device.</p>
            <p>New and unique to the Bookeye&reg 4 book scanner family is the integrated <b>V shaped cradle </b>that
                allows users to scan
                documents lying flat, as well as originals opened in the 120 degree <b>V shaped cradle</b> for maximum
                protection to the document&acute;s spine. </p>

            <p>Controls such as a large color WVGA touchscreen, trigger buttons on the scanning area or a large preview
                monitor, attached ergonomically optimized at the rear of the scanner, round out the brilliant technical
                features of the Bookeye&reg 4. </p>
            <p>All Bookeye&reg book scanners are CE, UL, cUL, WEEE, RoHS and Energy Star compliant. </p><br>
