        <h2>The Industry Standard <b>Book Scanner</b> Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup></h2>
        <h3>Scan2Net<sup>&reg;</sup> Technology as the Basis of the Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> <b>Book Scanner </b></h3>
        <p>The Scan2Net<sup>&reg;</sup> technological platform forms the basis of all Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup>
            <b>book scanners</b> and WideTEK<sup>&reg;</sup> large format scanners. Scan2Net<sup>&reg;</sup>
            eliminates the need for proprietary drivers and interface cards and uses what is currently fastest,
            open connection to PC-based systems: TCP / IP over Ethernet.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.scan2net.de/" title="fast but secure network scanning"
              target="_blank">Scan2Net<sup>&reg;</sup></a>
            â€“ the firmware kernel on all Image Access scanners- is compatible with operating systems such as Windows,
            Linux, Mac OS,
            Unix and all Web browsers like Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome and Firefox.</p>
        <p>The numerous new features of HTML5 markup language, which is already implemented in most browsers, further
            extend the capabilities of the scanners.</p>
        <p>A 64 bit Linux-based, virus protected operating system enables faster internal processing of the image data
            and optimizes the scanning process.</p>
        <p>The latest generation of Intel processors make Scan2Net devices highly energy efficient.
            Thanks to the 4 GB of RAM, very large volumes of data can be processed at remarkable speeds and virtually
            unlimited job sizes are possible.</p>
        <h3>Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> - A Book Scanner Success Story for Over 18 Years</h3>
        <p>The Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> brand of overhead <b>book scanners</b>
            from Image Access has been a synonym worldwide for gentle and protective digitization of bound and stapled
            documents in large and smaller formats over the past 18 years. </p>
        <p>The first generation of Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> book scanners was developed in 1995, a grayscale system for
            documents up to A3 format.
            A year later, you could already scan documents in the A2+ format. </p>
        <p>This was followed by the models Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> 2 and Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> 2 plus, which were
            built between 2000 and 2011.
            The Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> 2 was the first color book scanner from Image Access and with over 2,500
            successful installations around the globe. </p>

             title="Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> 2plus - Book Scanners for Libraries and Archives"
             alt="Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> 2plus - Book Scanners for Libraries and Archives" hspace="10" vspace="10"
             align="left"/>
        <p>Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> 2 was available in various different versions: up to A1+ size, with reproduction
            lighting, automatic book cradle and glass plate,
            depending on the requirements the customer had. From the beginning, all Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> 2 book
            scanners had low emission lamps. </p>
        <p>Eight years of experience with Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> 1 and Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup>
            2 in library and archive environments and the rapidly growing installation base, a third
            Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup>
            book scanner was developed in 2004. With this system, Image Access addressed the ever increasing demands
            from the market to satisfy
            requirements for mass digitization projects, which depend on stability, productivity and high image quality.
            The Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup>
            3 family of book scanners was born - digitizing documents up to A1+ in size and with 600 dpi optical
            resolution, distinguished by an integrated,
            automatic book cradle with an optional glass plate and a completely revised illumination system which
            featured UV- and IR-free LED lamps. </p>

             alt="Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> 3 - Ideal book scanner for gentle scanning" hspace="10" vspace="10"
             align="left"/>
        <p>Customers appreciated the universal applicability of the Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> 3 and the excellent quality
            of the scan results.
            A perfect example of the unique and universal qualities of the the Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup>
            3 was the implementation of over 90 Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> 3 book scanners in the Japanese Parliamentary
            Library,
            in which not only the highest quality scanning results were required but also that the book scanners are
            tough enough to withstand 24/7 operation. </p>
        <h3>Unique <b>V Shaped Cradle</b> Again Sets Standards</h3>

             align="left"/>
        <p>At CeBIT 2010, the Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> 4 product family was launched.
            Once again, all the experience and requirements of what had grown to over 4,000 installations were compiled
            and implemented
            into a completely new book scanner concept. The attributes that set Bookeye apart from other book scanners
            on the market remained -
            - high productivity and top quality of the scanner, scanning documents up to A1+ at 600 optical dpi and a
            level of usability so simple that it
            could be implemented as a self service device.</p>
        <p>New and unique to the Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> 4 book scanner family is the integrated <b>V shaped cradle </b>that
            allows users to scan
            documents lying flat, as well as originals opened in the 120 degree <b>V shaped cradle</b> for maximum
            protection to the document&acute;s spine. </p>

             vspace="10" align="left"/>
        <p>Controls such as a large color WVGA touchscreen, trigger buttons on the scanning area or a large preview
            monitor, attached ergonomically optimized at the rear of the scanner, round out the brilliant technical
            features of the Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> 4. </p>
        <p>All Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> book scanners are CE, UL, cUL, WEEE, RoHS and Energy Star compliant. </p><br>
