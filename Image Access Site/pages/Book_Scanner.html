                <h3>Bookeye 4 V3</h3>
                <p>With this new member of the Bookeye&reg; family, Image Access placed an emphasis on developing a
                    scanner
                    which is compact, easy to operate and competitively priced; to bring high end professional scanning
                    to an
                    even larger population of users. The efficient Bookeye&reg; 4 V3 digitizes source material such as
                    bound
                    documents at high speeds in up to 400 dpi optical resolution and formats up to DIN A3.</p>
                <p>Over 17 years of electronic, optical and mechanical engineering experience went into the creation and
                    manufacture of the Bookeye&reg; 4 models. The clever mirror mechanism captures the document
                    precisely from
                    edge to edge, whether it is a flat document or a book open at an angle of 120 degrees.</p>
                <p>The V-shaped book cradle was optimized to reduce the risk of damage to book spines and binding during
                    digitization. The book cradle holds the open book at an angle of 120 degrees; enough to effectively
                    scan the
                    contents of a page, while gently preserving the original subject matter.</p>

                <h3>Bookeye 4 V2</h3>
                <p>Without being loaded with a lot of costly, unnecessary "features", the Bookeye &reg; 4 V2 is still a
                    full-fledged book scanner or book copier, ready for use anywhere where grayscale is enough. </p>
                <p>Equipped with a standard scanning application, Bookeye&reg; 4 V2 scans documents, such as magazines,
                    files,
                    folders, bound documents, contracts, and accounting ledgers at a resolution of 400 dpi at high
                    speeds.</p>
                <p>The clearly structured menus on the touchscreen guide the user intuitively through the operation of
                    the
                    scanner. Scanned images can be stored directly on the device to a USB flash drive or sent via eMail.
                    Uploads
                    to an FTP server, printing to any network or connected printer and saving the images to network
                    drives are
                    also standard Bookeye&reg; 4 V2 functions.</p>
