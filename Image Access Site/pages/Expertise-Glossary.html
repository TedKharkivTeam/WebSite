        <h3 class="expertise-second-title">The following is a glossary of scanning related technical terminology.</h3>
        <br>
        <ul class="infoblock__ul-disc">
            <li><span class="text--bold">8 bit grayscale</span> contains 256 possible shades of gray.</li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">24 bit color</span> contains a possible 16 million distinct colors. This method
                of scanning produces the
                largest file size.
            </li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">32 bit color</span> contains a possible 16 million distinct colors as with 24
                bit color and the other
                eight bits are used as a separate layer for representing levels of translucency in an object or image.
            </li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">Bitmap</span> provides a way to store a binary image, that is, an image in
                which each pixel is either
                black or white (or any two colors).
            </li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">Color depth</span> is the number of bits used to indicate the color of
                a single pixel in
                a bitmapped image. (See 8 bit grayscale, 24 bit color and 32 bit color above).
            </li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">Crop</span> refers to removing excess information that is surrounding an image
                of the original document
                but is not part of the image, like a white border.
            </li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">Deskew</span> is the ability of a scanner to detect that the item being scanned
                is not straight and to
                realign the scanned image to be straight.
            </li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">DPI (dots per inch)</span>, the number of pixels per inch used
                in an image and
                determines the resolution of the image. See also resolution.
            </li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">Duplex</span> indicates two sided documents. A duplex scanner will scan both
                sides of a document at the
                same time.
            </li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">Enhanced halftone</span> is a conversion of a multi-tonal image to a bitonal
                image in such a way that the
                impression of a multi-tonal image is retained.
            </li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">Footprint</span> represents the length and width dimensions of the scanner,
                indicating how much space is
                required for the device.
            </li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">JPEG (jpg)</span> stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the
                committee that created the JPEG
                standard. It defines how an image is compressed into a stream of bytes and decompressed back
                to an image.
            </li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">Mbit/s (megabits per second)</span> – the number of bits of data that are
                transferred per second. 1
                megabit = 1,000,000 bits.
            </li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">OCR (Optical Character Recognition)</span> is electronic conversion of
                scanned images of
                handwritten, typewritten or printed text into machine-encoded text.
            </li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">PDF (Portable Document Format)</span> is an open file format created by Adobe
                in 1993 and is an accepted
                standard for digital file sharing.
            </li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">Resolution</span> is degree of fineness with which an image can be
                recorded or produced, often
                expressed as the number of pixels per unit of length (typically an inch).
            </li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">Scan2Net</span> technology provides a code-free client via any web browser
                for all
                Image Access scanners. Scan2Net frees the host PC from all image related and time
                critical tasks.
            </li>
            <li><span class="text--bold">TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)</span> is a storage format widely supported by
                image manipulation
                software applications.
