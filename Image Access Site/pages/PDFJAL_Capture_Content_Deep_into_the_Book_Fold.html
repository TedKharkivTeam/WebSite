            <h2 class="brochure-title-left">Deep into the Book Foldt</h2>
            <p>Bound journals often have content deep into the book fold. It is
                quite difficult and sometimes impossible to capture this content
                with a typical flatbed scanner or photocopier.</p>
            <p>There are three methods for effectively capturing this content:</p>
            <ul class="blue-doth blue-bullet">
                <li>Scanning in the direction of the curve and reducing
                    the scanning speed at the book fold — Bookeye 4
                    V3, V2, 8. V1 scanner models
                </li>
                <li> Capturing the left and right pages with two separate
                    cameras positioned at ideal angles — Click scanner
                </li>
                <li>Using a flatbed scanner with a book-edge feature
                    — BookEdge scanner
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Bookeye 4 scanners employ the first method, which requires high
                resolution optics. Bookeye 4’s left-to-right scanning allows it to
                follow the contours of virtually any book. allowing it to capture
                deep into the book fold and decompress the compressed con-
                tent. This feature combined with its advanced lighting system
                and superior optics also allows the Bookeye 4 to produce better
                quality 600 dpi images than any other book scanner available.</p>
            <p>The second method is employed by Click scanners, which have
                two cameras. Both the Bookeye 4 and the Click are face-up
                scanners, which are faster and easier to use than face-down
                scanners, while our BookEdge has the lowest initial cost.</p>
            <p>Bookeye 4 and Click scanners both have laser curve sensor sys-
                tems that allows them to easily straighten out the worst curves
                and produce clear, professional quality images.</p>

                <p>When used in its native mode, the BookEdge scanner employs the third method to capture content
                    deep into the book fold without damaging the
                    spine. A laser curve sensor is not necessary.</p>
                <p>To achieve increased speed and throughput, two
                    pages at a time can be scanned, and BSCAN ILL
                    will split the pages in two, eliminate book curve
                    and skew, and remove fan and gutter.</p>
