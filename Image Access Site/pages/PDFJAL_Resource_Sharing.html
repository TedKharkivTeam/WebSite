        <h4 class="sitalic">Share with Archivist & Digital Course Materials Creation</h4>
        <p class="page3__inline">The exceptional image quality produced by Bookeye and
            WideTEK scanners affords opportunities for resource shar-
            ing with Archivists as well as use for projects and creating digital course materials. Reduce your cost per article
            scanned by sharing equipment costs and helping other
            departments to switch to digital format and get color content
            without the additional cost of color copiers or color microfilming.</p>

            Use some digitization projects funding
            to purchase the Bookeye
            4 V1, V2 or V3 and dramatically
            reduce lLL's share of the cost
            of state-of-the-art scanning
            equipment. A complementary schedule
            is usually easy to agree upon. Note that while the
            Bookeye 4 V2's standard image quality (high quality
            400dpi) meets and exceeds digitization standards, a
            600dpi option can be purchased later, if desired.

                able digital cameras have 50 megapixels or less. And those pixels
                must be further divided into red, green and blue sub-pixels, which
                can reduce the clarity of color images by 40%.</p>

            <p>Since books don't move while being scanned, Bookeyes employ
                linear CCD technology to produce ultra-clear images with
                astounding 140 megapixels. Each pixel in a linear CCD includes
                full red, green and blue sub-pixels.</p>

            <p>Bookeye 4 scanners utilize a unique state-of-the-art rotating
                mirror system that dramatically reduces clarity loss at the
                corners of the image due to the limitations of lens systems.
                Bookeyes can also scan in V-mode or ï¬‚at-mode, and they scan
                from left to right, allowing them to follow the curves of the book.</p>
