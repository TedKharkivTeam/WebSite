        <p class="content__formatter">
            In the U.S. alone, KIC serves over four million students at the top "brick and mortar" (non-online)
            colleges and universities. With the introduction of the KIC BookEdge, KIC Click, and KIC Click Mini,
            KIC is now affordable for virtually all institutions of higher learning and full-service public
            libraries. Last decade, libraries typically 'added' several KICs, but since 2010 libraries have begun to
            replace their entire patron-use copier fleets with self-serve book scanning systems.
