        <h2 class="expertise-title">File Size or Image Quality?</h2>
        <h3 class="expertise-second-title">Predict storage requirements with the File Size Calculator<br>Another great
            tool from Image Access!</h3>
        <p class="infoblock__p">Often, customers want to evaluate the actual file size of individually scanned documents
            upfront to get an
            idea about the storage requirements for a project. With storage memory and Internet bandwidth increasing
            constantly, it is time to re-evaluate quality versus storage requirements.</p>
        <p class="infoblock__p">The File Size Calculator is a simple, easy to use tool which will assist in getting an
            estimation about the
            expected file size. It should be noted that only the file size computed for raw data is comparable with
            other scanners. Scan2Net scanners from Image Access and their licensees use very specific,
            highly optimized compression algorithms which take all camera parameters into account.</p>
        <p class="infoblock__p">Details about these compression strategies can be found in
            <a class="infoblock__a" href="WP-Compression-and-Loss.html"
               title="Read our white paper Compression and Losses" target="_blank">
                our White Paper "Compression and Losses"
            </a>.
        </p>
        <p class="infoblock__p">In the early days of scanning, black &amp; white was common not only because of file
            size but also because
            color scanners were slower than monochrome scanners by magnitudes. Today, Image Access CCD based scanners
            are running at the same speed in monochrome or color and CIS based scanners are running at 50% of the
            monochrome speed, outperforming many competitors by a margin. Color versus monochrome is therefore not a real
            speed issue in most cases &ndash; which makes file size a final criteria for making a purchasing
            decision.</p>
        <p class="infoblock__p">The following should also be considered. File size in TIFF G4 compression is
            significantly smaller than a
            normal JPG but this comes at the expense of reducing 24bits of color to only one bit before the run length
            compression is applied. It takes 30,000 full color DINA0 or E-size scans at 300dpi and stored as 24bit JPEG
            to fill up a normal 500GB hard disk. Is it really worth reducing the image quality so significantly as is
            done with TIFF G4 and be able to store only five times more on the same drive?</p>
        <p class="infoblock__p">Nearly every other vendor uses some kind of third party compression algorithms which
            cannot take the camera
            specifics into account. As a result, a comparable image from a non-Scan2Net scanner can
            contain up to 100% more data (i.e. JPEG compression) than on a Scan2Net scanner. If you use
            this calculator for other than a Scan2Net scanner you should add 50-100% to the estimated
            file size if JPEG compression is used and about 20-50% if Tiff-G4 is used.</p>
