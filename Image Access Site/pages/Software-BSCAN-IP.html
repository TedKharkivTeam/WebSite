        <h2 class="brochure-title-center">Automated Image Processing</h2>
        <p class="width-seventy-percent">With BSCAN-IP automated and manual image cleanup and quality checking can
            be performed on PCs without
            scanners. A single BSCAN-IP station can process over a million images per day, depending on the number and
            types of image processing functions that are automatically checked and any images that may have a problem
            are
            flagged for manual review and possible correction.</p>
        <p class="width-seventy-percent">If BSCAN's Undo Image Processing feature is enabled, all image processing
            performed automatically can be
            manually undone and performed again with different parameters in later stage.</p>

                    <p>Removes black borders and straightens skewed documents. If a questionable crop and deskew is
                        performed, the image is flagged for later review and possible manual crop and deskew using the
                        mouse.</p>

                    <p>With this feature, if a page is blank, it is automatically flagged for deletion. If there is a
                        chance that it has any content, a small scribble for example, then the page is flagged for
                        review. During review, the flag for deletion can be turned off and on.</p>

                    <p>This function is very effective with most types of documents. If BSCAN has any doubt that a
                        rotated image should have been rotated, a flag is set for review and possible correction.</p>

                        the text. During the auto-matic processing, if BSCAN despeckles an image and senses a possible
                        loss of readability, the image is flagged for review and correction.</p>

                        are flagged for manual review and correction by changing the DRS setting. A grayscale or color
