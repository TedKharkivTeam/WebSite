        <p class="width-seventy-percent">With BSCAN-IP automated and manual image cleanup and quality checking can
            be performed on PCs without
            scanners. A single BSCAN-IP station can process over a million images per day, depending on the number and
            types of image processing functions that are automatically checked and any images that may have a problem
            are
            flagged for manual review and possible correction.</p>
        <p class="width-seventy-percent">If BSCAN's Undo Image Processing feature is enabled, all image processing
            performed automatically can be
            manually undone and performed again with different parameters in later stage.</p>

                        review. During review, the flag for deletion can be turned off and on.</p>
