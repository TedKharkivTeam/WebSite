            <h3 style="font-style: italic;">A message to students</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Higher education libraries across America hold $100 Billion in scholarly knowledge, the majority of
                    which can't be found on the internet. This knowledge has been amassed through careful selection over
                    many years and is augmented at substantial expense every year. And, thanks to U.S. copyright law,
                    this knowledge is <strong>free</strong> to scan an unlimited number of times, or until books
                    disintegrate.</p>
                <p>Because of this, hundreds of universities across America have added high-speed self-serve book
                    scanning machines to their library floors; machines that create digital content at rates of 5 to 20
                    pages per minute. These self-serve Knowledge Imaging Centers are much gentler on books and produce
                    higher-quality digital content than the paper reprints produced by paper copiers. The image can cost
                    as little as 1&cent; per page and are readable on tablets & smart phones as well as
                    notebooks and regular PCs. The images can be printed at any time for those who still prefer hard
                    copy.</p>
                <section>
                    <h3>What can be done?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Fortunately, academic libraries exist to serve students. The first step is for students to
                            inform
                            the libraries as to just how important it is to switch from paper copiers to digital book
                            scanners
                            that can print if desired. The next step depends on circumstances at your particular
                            institution. Every year, libraries
                            spend many times more money on printed books and journals than the cost of an entire fleet
                            of new
                            high-speed scanners. But some libraries have no control over any of that budget money. At
                            these institutions,
                            faculty specifies what is purchased. So, the library must use other funds to purchase these
                            units.
                            If yours is such an institution, it is especially important to convey just how much students
                            value getting unlimited,
                            free digital content from their libraries, and that it's worth the effort to scrape together
                            the necessary funds from various other budgets.</p>
                        <p>Another means of acquiring KIC systems is to use student-administered funds (i.e. student
                            technology
                            funds). These non-library funds can be used to purchase a pilot set of one small KIC, one
                            medium KIC and one
                            large KIC. Once they're in the library, their popularity with students will make it much
                            easier to
                            justify all the efforts necessary to piece together the funds and to tell the entrenched
                            copier companies
                            that the library floor is no longer their domain.</p>
                        <p>Alternately a relatively small portion of these funds can be used to upgrade from basic
                            copier
                            replacement Knowledge Imaging Centers that scan 5 pages per minute to faster KIC systems
                            that scan up to 20 pages per minute.</p>

                    <h3>Should copier companies determine how one of your university's great resources is to be

                        <p>Should copier companies determine how one of your university's great resources is to be used?
                            That is just what is happening in many universities. If your students want to go digital
                            (digitize on demand),
                            you may have to take it up with the university department that negotiated a campus-wide
                            contract
                            with a copier company and ask that the library floors be excerpted from the contract
                            because:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                copiers damage books and waste papers
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                copiers are slower than scanners
                            </li>
                            <li>digital is the future <em>(and copier companies have had digital for over 10
                                years!)</em>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
