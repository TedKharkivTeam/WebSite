        <div class="double-wrap__column">

            <h3 class="brochure-subtitle-center">Copiers are Outmoded</h3>
            <p>Since the first KIC was delivered to an academic library in 2004, the days of photocopiers for
                patron
                use
                in academic libraries and even public libraries were numbered. And now with the rapid explosion
                of
                tablet computers and electronic readers, the demand in academic libraries for electronic copies
                has
                substantially outstripped the demand for printed copies. The demand for electronic copies in
                public
                libraries is also reaching a tipping point.</p>
            <p>The ability to capture virtually unlimited numbers of pages of research into a tablet or
                electronic
                reader and search through that material on the Internet with a tablet, eReader or notebook PC
                that
                can
                be used just about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely valuable. In this digital age,
                academic
                libraries are compelled to go hybrid for three reasons: 1) the high demand for digital content;
                2)
                their
                existing print collections contain vast amounts of information that cannot be found on the
                Internet;
                and
                3) students are receptive to the price of electronic copies - typically free.</p>
            <p>So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo copiers? There are three main
                factors
                that
                keep the cost of photo- copies high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner and ink; 2) photo-
                copiers
                require a lot of maintenance due to the number of moving parts; and 3) all major photocopier
                brands
                use
                a distributed service model.</p>
            <div class="infoblock__double-wrap">
                <p class="infoblock__double__double-p">In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC because KIC has
                    split
                    the
                    scan/copy functions into three
                    separate machines, choosing the best of breed for each. As a result, KIC offers the best book
                    scanners
                    by themselves or with a loose-leaf paper (ADF) scanner. Virtually any off-the-shelf laser or
                    inkjet
                    printer can be added to any KIC system, so you can optimize costs and speeds, and offer
                    affordable
                    color.</p>

            <h3>Click vs. Copiers</h3>
            <p>This graph compares the total costs of one color KIC Click system with two color copiers
                and
                with
                two black and white copiers. Both copiers are the kinds typically seen in academic libraries.
                One
                KIC
                Click is compared with two copiers because its face-up operation yields well over two
                times
                the
                performance of a typical copier. The costs are broken into three main areas: equipment and
                maintenance,
                consumables, and patron usage time. With KIC Click, electronic output is assumed to be preferred
                over
                print
                90% of the time. That ratio has ranged from 75-95% electronic in 2012, but is certain to rise in
                the
                future</p>

            <h3 class="brochure-subtitle-center">No More Book Spine Damage!</h3>
            <p>Thick books with stiff spines and content that runs deep into the bookfold are often damaged when
                copied.
                KIC
                Bookeye 4 easily captures content without damaging book spines.

                    KIC automatically removes black edges, straightens content, and produces clean, professional

                    reports.

            <p><i>KIC Click &amp; Click Mini handle thick books beautifully. Its
                contour finding laser allows it
                to flatten even the most curved books
                and produce text that is clear and undistorted. KIC automatically adds margins for print-ready image
                quality.</i></p>


            <h3 class="brochure-subtitle-center">Click Mini Scans 3 Times Faster</h3>
            <p>Statistics from five million scanning sessions across America revealed a median session length of
                23
                pages.
                So, most of the time spent during a KIC session is spent scanning.
                Face up scanning has been proven to be three times faster than face down scanning.
                So why is speed so important</p>
            <ul class="blue-bullet blue-bullet--pull-right">
                <li>It's economical. One Click can replace multiple copiers or other face-down scanning
                    machines.
                </li>
                <li>It gives patrons another reason to visit your library.</li>
                <li>It's green. The faster it is, the more use it will get and the less the copier will be used.

            </div>
            <p>
                Over the years, many libraries experimented with color copiers, but could never find a formula
                that
                worked. If the fees were low, patrons would copy materials with so much color that the library
                would
                spend more on ink than the fees they were collecting. If the fees were too high, the usage would
                be
                so low that the cost of the machine couldn't be justified.
            </p>
            <p>
                KIC calculates the amount of color in an image before it is printed. So the fee for copies with
                a
                little bit of color can be the same as the fee for black and white copies. If a copy has a lot
                of
                color, the fee can be increased in proportion to the cost of the color ink or toner. This
                wonderful
                feature should be a simple, easy byproduct of the digital age, and it is with KIC.
