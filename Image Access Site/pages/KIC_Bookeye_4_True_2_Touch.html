        <p>Ease-of-use is a central feature of KIC. Its large, 22 inch touch screen and its large "Scan" and "Save, Send
            or Print" buttons that occupy a very large portion of the touch screen clearly convey how easy KIC is to
            use. The Save button defaults to an output method and file format that is selectable by the institution. If
            a flash drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it will save to
            the flash drive. Users can override the default output method by manually selecting one or more other
            methods of output.</p>
        <p>KIC Bookeye 4's high speed is derived as much from its ultra-simple, true two-touch interface as from its
            face-up design that obviates the need to flip books over and over again during the capture process.</p>

        <!--<h2>KIC's True2Touch TM User Interface, Especially Forgiving for Beginners</h2><br><br>-->
        <!--<ul>-->
        <!--<li>KIC is very agile, and allows the user to jump from just about anywhere in the touch screen system to-->
        <!--just about anywhere else, directly and usually with a single touch.-->
        <!--This modern, 'modeless' design is easier to use, but difficult to create.-->
        <!--</li>-->
        <!--<li>KIC's large buttons and controls are easy to use, even for people with unsteady hands.</li>-->
        <!--<li>KIC gradually expands and contracts controls such as brightness, con- trast and DPI so users can easliy-->
        <!--follow their screen activity.-->
        <!--</li>-->
        <!--<li>KIC doesn't delete original images when you clip a photo or excerpt of text unless you tell it to.</li>-->
        <!--<li>KIC lets you output to many different destinations in a single session.-->
        <!--Once you've scanned a document, you can change your mind as to where you would like it to output. For-->
        <!--example, you may have wanted to save to USB, but learned your USB drive is full.-->
        <!--Or you may scan so much that it exceeds your email limit. Or after scanning and collating a mass of-->
        <!--research, you decide that you want to share the research with others.-->
        <!--</li>-->
        <!--</ul>-->
        <!--<h2>Two Large Screens for Simplicity & Power</h2>-->
        <!--<p>It's easy to undervalue screen size. For 20 years, all cellphone makers relent- lessly pursued smaller and-->
        <!--smaller screens until very recently when one com- pany reversed that trend. They realized that people want-->
        <!--the largest screen that will fit in their pocket/purse and hand. This is because display screens are our-->
        <!--window to the digital world, and touch screens give us control over that world. As big as self-serve-->
        <!--scanning systems are, it makes sense to have a very large touch screen. And with the low prices for high-->
        <!--quality displays, it is compelling to add a separate display screen. In 2002, DLSG realized this, when the-->
        <!--first KIC system was designed. Today, with nearly 10 years more experience than any other vendor, DLSG has-->
        <!--the most understandable, easy to use and powerful user interface for self-serve book scanning, and it's-->
        <!--based on dual screens. The view screen shows very large, clear images of what you've scanned, allow- ing the-->
        <!--touch screen to have big, easy to understand buttons and other controls. Display screens are our portals-->
        <!--into the digital world, and touch screens are the easiest way to control that world. That's why DLSG-->
        <!--provides large, 24 inch, full HD displays and equally large touch screens with most of its KIC systems.</p>-->
