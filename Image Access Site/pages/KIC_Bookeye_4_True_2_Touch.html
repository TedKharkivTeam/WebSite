        <h2>True 2 Touch TM User Interface</h2>
        Ease-of-use is a central feature of KIC.
        Its large, 22 inch touch screen and its large "Scan" and "Save, Send or Print" buttons that occupy a very large
        portion of the touch screen clearly convey how easy KIC is to use.
        The Save button defaults to an output method and file format that is selectable by the institution. If a flash
        drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it will save to the flash
        drive.
        Users can override the default output method by manually selecting one or more other methods of output.<br><br>
        KIC Bookeye 4's high speed is derived as much from its ultra-simple, true two-touch interface as from its
        face-up design that obviates the need to flip books over and over again during the capture process.
        The tabletop model KIC Bookeye 4 has all the True2Touch capabilities of the full-size KIC. It has its own
        tabletop version of the SmartDock, and of course, an ADF scanner can be placed anywhere on the table.
        ADA compliance is achieved by purchasing a table with a 30 inch clearance to the floor and a 31 inch height. KIC
        Bookeye 4's elegant design puts the full KIC self-serve digitization functionality into a compact and appealing
        space.
        Its 17" touch screen and large preview screen and capture surface are at the perfect height for wheelchair
        access.
        The KIC Bookeye 4 also offers an optional desktop configuration with a single 22" touch/preview display<br>

        <h2>KIC's True2Touch TM User Interface, Especially Forgiving for Beginners</h2><br><br>
        <ul style="list-style-image: url('../images/blue-bullet.png');margin-left:3%;">
            <li>KIC is very agile, and allows the user to jump from just about anywhere in the touch screen system to
                just about anywhere else, directly and usually with a single touch.
                This modern, 'modeless' design is easier to use, but difficult to create.
            </li>
            <li>KIC's large buttons and controls are easy to use, even for people with unsteady hands.</li>
            <li>KIC gradually expands and contracts controls such as brightness, con- trast and DPI so users can easliy
                follow their screen activity.
            </li>
            <li>KIC doesn't delete original images when you clip a photo or excerpt of text unless you tell it to.</li>
            <li>KIC lets you output to many different destinations in a single session.
                Once you've scanned a document, you can change your mind as to where you would like it to output. For
                example, you may have wanted to save to USB, but learned your USB drive is full.
                Or you may scan so much that it exceeds your email limit. Or after scanning and collating a mass of
                research, you decide that you want to share the research with others.
            </li>
            <h2>Two Large Screens for Simplicity & Power</h2>
            It's easy to undervalue screen size. For 20 years, all cellphone makers relent- lessly pursued smaller and
            smaller screens until very recently when one com- pany reversed that trend.
            They realized that people want the largest screen that will fit in their pocket/purse and hand. This is
            because display screens are our window to the digital world, and touch screens give us control over that
            world.
            As big as self-serve scanning systems are, it makes sense to have a very large touch screen. And with the
            low prices for high quality displays, it is compelling to add a separate display screen.
            In 2002, DLSG realized this, when the first KIC system was designed.
            Today, with nearly 10 years more experience than any other vendor, DLSG has the most understandable, easy to
            use and powerful user interface for self-serve book scanning, and it's based on dual screens.
            The view screen shows very large, clear images of what you've scanned, allow- ing the touch screen to have
            big, easy to understand buttons and other controls.
            Display screens are our portals into the digital world, and touch screens are the easiest way to control
            that world. That's why DLSG provides large, 24 inch, full HD displays and equally large touch screens with
            most of its KIC systems.
