                <p>The Opus digitization process was designed specifically for academic libraries,
                    museums
                    and
                    archives. Use
                    Opus FreeFlow to build digital assets for preservation, archive, digital collections for the Web,
                    and
                    for
                    viewing software. Its image treatment processes such as fan, gutter and book curvature removal, and
                    content
                    location and registration, are dramatically faster and easier to use than photo editing
                    software.</p>
                <p>Opus FreeFlow operates a wide array of preservation quality scanners and allows for
                    the
                    import
                    of existing
                    images as well. It then groups images into objects (i.e. books), which are easily managed and
                    processed.
                    Finally, it renders those objects into a variety of derivatives.</p>

                <p>With Opus FreeFlow 3-tab interface, users can switch dynamically between scanning, image
                    treatment and
                    outputting derivatives. Multi-page objects can be reopened and reprocessed at any time. Pages can be
                    deleted
                    and rescanned and new pages can be scanned and inserted. Unlimited derivatives can be created with
                    variations in image size, resolution, format and file type.</p>
                <p>Opus FreeFlow is fully compatible with Opus Digitization WorkFlow software. While objects

                <p>Opus support for the Open Archive Initiative (OAI) takes
                    on several forms. Opus has the ability to generate export derivative sets
                    which can be added into an OAI-compliant metadata repository and made available
                    via the OAI-PMH to any OAI compliant metadata harvesters. The DLSG operates
                    and manages the cloud infrastructure necessary to support this need, thus
                    freeing our users from having to acquire and maintain the expertise to
                    make their chosen objects available to the digital archive community at large.
                    For example, this feature of Opus allows its users to easily contribute to the
                    Digital Public Library Project (DPLA) with just a few clicks.</p>

                <p>The underlying object resources (images) described in the OAI-compliant

                    resources can be uploaded to a DLSG-maintained archive repository as part of the OAI publishing
                    process.
                </p>
                <p>Published objects can be further queried and made available
                    by Opus's support for the OAI-ORE project. In addition to the cloud based OAI
                    publishing features, the DLSG cloud repository allows the user community of
                    Opus Systems to share or exchange Opus objects among themselves.</p>

            <p class="OAI5">Opus' hierarchical metadata capture is controlled by templates that can be created
                and modified to fit virtually any requirements. Input field characteristics include
                :required/optional, repeatable/one occurrence only and other characteristics
                that can be specified when templates are constructed of modified. Opus provides several
                generic templates to capture the data necessary to create virtual library output formats.</p>
            <div class="block_hierarchical_metadata">
                <p class="block_hierarchical_metadata_table">Opus provides a straightforward graphical interface for
                    creating and modifying hierarchical templates. The templates carry the characteristics
                    of XML elements and attributes. Data entry rules such as required/optional and
                    single/multiple can be assigned to each field. During metadata capture and entry,
                    Opus enforces the rules, thus simplifying metadata entry and reducing errors.</p>

            <div class="block_hierarchical_metadata_table2">
                <p>In addition, the Opus hierarchical metadata input facility allows
                    users to scroll back and forth through the images of an object (e.g. pages of
                    a book ) while reviewing and entering metadata.</p>

                    <p>One of the key benefits of the Opus Metadata capture system
                        is its flexibility in allowing project curators to not only design and codify
                        their own specialized metadata data capture needs, but to link these metadata collection
                        sets to customized object meronomies. This degree of metadata capture
                        task standardization affords the project's curator the confidence to
                        know that their project's metadata needs will be meet by the data collection4
                        team.</p>
                    <p>Once these completed metadata collection templates have
                        been defined , they can be shared back into curator's community,
                        thus allowing the project to expand beyond a single institute. This ensures
                        that the resultant aggregate of objects can be blended seamlessly together
                        into a single master archive to be used by the project's curators to
                        publish their collective work as part of a single repository.</p>

                Opus FreeFlow digitization software provides all the necessary functionality
                to create digital books and other materials from scanned images. Prior to Opus,
                digitization had to be performed one image at a time using photos editors for image
                treatment, and content managers for keying metadata. With Opus FreeFlow, after scanning
                and treating images, digital derivative images are output to destinations such as digital
                content management systems, and digital master images to digital archive systems.<br><br>
                Opus Digitization Workflow software allows for the use temporary workers with minimal
                training while minimizing the chance of errors and ensuring that preservation quality standards
                are met. Unlike FreeFlow, Opus Workflow applies somewhat rigid managements principles.
                Opus FreeFlow and Opus Digitization Workflow work seamlessly together and can be used by a
                trained digitization staff member at any time to perform processing and output independently
                of Opus Workflow.

                Opus FreeFlow also works with third-party software. For example, if a user wishes to perform an image
                treatment
                function supported by a popular photo editor, the press of a button in Opus FreeFlow can launch the
                third-party
                application with the current image ready for editing. Once the edits are completed and saved, exiting
                the photo
                editor will return the user to Opus FreeFlow with the image showing the modifications that were made.
