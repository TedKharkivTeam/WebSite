            The Opus digitization process was designed specifically for academic libraries, museums and archives. Use
            Opus FreeFlow to build digital assets for preservation, archive, digital collections for the Web, and for
            viewing software. Its image treatment processes such as fan, gutter and book curvature removal, and content
            location and registration, are dramatically faster and easier to use than photo editing software.
        </p>
        <p>
            Opus FreeFlow operates a wide array of preservation quality scanners and allows for the import of existing
            images as well. It then groups images into objects (i.e. books), which are easily managed and processed.
            Finally, it renders those objects into a variety of derivatives.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            With Opus FreeFlow 3-tab interface, users can switch dynamically between scanning, image treatment and
            outputting derivatives. Multipage objects can be reopened and reprocessed at any time. Pages can be deleted
            and rescanned and new pages can be scanned and inserted. Unlimited derivatives can be created with
            variations in image size, resolution, format and file type.
        </p>
        <p>
            Opus FreeFlow is fully compatible with Opus Digitization Workflow software. While objects are in the middle
            of the Opus workflow, they can be opened with Opus FreeFlow for additional scanning, image modification and
            derivative generation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Opus FreeFlow digitization software provides all the necessary functionality to create digital books and
            other materials from scanned images. Prior to Opus, digitization had to be performed one image at a time
            using photo editors for image treatment, and content managers for keying metadata. With Opus Freeflow, after
            scanning and treating images, digital derivative images are output to destinations such as digital content
            management systems and digital master images to digital archive systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Opus Workflow software allows for the use of temporary workers with minimal training while minimizing the
            chance of errors and ensuring that preservation quality standards are met. Unlike FreeFlow, Opus Workflow
            applies somewhat rigid management principles. Opus FreeFlow and Opus Digitization Workflow work seamlessly
            together to allow a trained digitization staff member to perform processing at any time and output
            independently of the structured workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, Opus FreeFlow works with third-party software. For example, if a user wishes to perform an
            image treatment function supported by a popular photo editor, the press of a button in Opus FreeFlow can
            launch the third-party application with the current image ready for editing. Once the edits are completed
            and saved, exiting the photo editor will return the user to Opus FreeFlow with the image showing the
            modifications that were made.
