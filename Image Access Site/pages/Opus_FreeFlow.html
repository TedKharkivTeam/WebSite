            <p class="opus_p1">The Opus digitization process was designed specifically for academic libraries, museums
                and
                archives. Use
                Opus FreeFlow to build digital assets for preservation, archive, digital collections for the Web, and
                for
                viewing software. Its image treatment processes such as fan, gutter and book curvature removal, and
                content
                location and registration, are dramatically faster and easier to use than photo editing software.</p>
            <p class="opus_p2">Opus FreeFlow operates a wide array of preservation quality scanners and allows for the
                import
                of existing
                images as well. It then groups images into objects (i.e. books), which are easily managed and processed.
                Finally, it renders those objects into a variety of derivatives.</p>
            <p class="opus_p3">With Opus FreeFlow 3-tab interface, users can switch dynamically between scanning, image
                treatment and
                outputting derivatives. Multipage objects can be reopened and reprocessed at any time. Pages can be
                deleted
                and rescanned and new pages can be scanned and inserted. Unlimited derivatives can be created with
                variations in image size, resolution, format and file type.</p>
            <p class="opus_p4">Opus FreeFlow is fully compatible with Opus Digitization WorkFlow software. While objects
                are
                in the middle
                of the Opus WorkFlow, they can be opened with Opus FreeFlow for additional scanning, image modification
                and
                derivative generation.</p>

            <strong class="OAI">OAI</strong>
            <p class="OAI2">Opus support for the Open Archive Initiative (OAI) takes
                on several forms. Opus has the ability to generate export derivative sets
                which can be added into an OAI-compliant metadata repository and made available
                via the OAI-PMH to any OAI compliant metadata harvesters. The DLSG operates
                and manages the cloud infrastructure necessary to support this need, thus
                freeing our users from having to acquire and maintain the expertise to
                make their chosen objects available to the digital archive community at large.
                For example, this feature of Opus allows its users to easily contribute to the
                Digital Public Library Project (DPLA) with just a few clicks.</p>
            <p class="OAI3">
                The underlying object resources (images) described in the OAI-compliant
                metadata export may either be hosted by the OPUS customers themselves or the
                resources can be uploaded to a DLSG-maintained archive repository as part of the OAI publishing process.
            </p>
            <p class="OAI4">Published objects can be further queried and made available
                by Opus's support for the OAI-ORE project. In addition to the cloud based OAI
                publishing features, the DLSG cloud repository allows the user community of
                Opus Systems to share or exchange Opus objects among themselves.</p>
            <p class="metadata_capture">Opus Hierarchical Metadata Capture</p>
            <p class="OAI5">Opus' hierarchical metadata capture is controlled by templates that can be created
                and modified to fit virtually any requirements. Input field characteristics include
                :required/optional, repeatable/one occurrence only and other characteristicsc
                that can be specified when templates are constructed of modified. Opus provides several
                generic templates to capture the data necessary to create virtual library output formats.</p>
            <p class="OAI6">Opus provides a straightforward graphical interface for
                creating and modifying hierarchical templates. The templates carry the charasterics
                of XML elements and attributes. Data entry rules such as required/optional and
                single/multiple can be assigned to each field. During metadata capture and entry,
                Opus enforces the rules, thus simplifying metadata entry and reducing errors.</p>
            <img class="table1_freeflow" src="../images/Opus_Free_Flow/table1.png"/>
            <p class="OAI7">In addition, the Opus hierarchical metadata input facility allows
                users to scroll back and forth through the images of an object (e.g. pages of
                a book ) while reviewing and entering metadata.</p>
            <img class="table2_freeflow" src="../images/Opus_Free_Flow/table2.png"/>
            <p class="OAI8">One of the key benefits of the Opus Metadata capture system
                is its flexibility in allowing project curators to not only design and codify
                their own specialized metadata data capture needs, but to link these metadata collection
                sets to customized object meronomies. This degree of metadata capture
                task standardization affords the project's curator the confidence to
                know that their project's metadata needs will be meet by the data collection4
                team.</p>
            <p class="OAI9">Once these completed metadata collection templates have
                been defined , they can be shared back into curator's community,
                thus allowing the project to expand beyond a single institute. This ensures
                that the resultant aggregate of objects can be blended seamlessly together
                into a single master archive to be used by the project's curators to
                publish their collective work as part of a single repository.</p>

            <h2 class="brochure-title-center">Opus Output: Image Derivatives & Metadata</h2>
            <p class="opus_output_block1">Opus has a library of script files for common XML, flat file
                and other output formats for the metadata and associated images of digital
                objects (e.g. METS,MODS,Dublin Core).This script library is expandable
                with an unlimited number of custom formats. In addition to selecting
                the desired output format(s) for the metadata , the clarity , size and output
                formats of the images can be specified (e.g TIFF,JPEG,PDF,PNG,etc.).</p>
            <p class="opus_output_block2">DLSG staff technicals can assist in modifying
                existing formats and creating new custom output formats.</p>
            <p class="opus_output_block3">The most exciting and immediately usable format
                that Opus creates is a Web-ready output that provides the experience of browsing
