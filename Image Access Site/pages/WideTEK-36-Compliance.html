            security standards and do not
            interfere with other devices. By constructive measures Image Access ensures that no harmful radiation in the
            form of electromagnetic emission and UV or infrared light exists. Because these kinds of scanners are heavy
            production machines with inherent risks to the operator, no one should operate a scanner from a vendor who
            cannot provide at least an IEC/UL 60950 or an IEC/EN 62368 safety report. </p>

            which are listed below. Our
