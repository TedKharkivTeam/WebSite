           <h2 class="brochure-title-center">KIC Serves Over Half of Students at Universities in America</h2>
           <p>
               In the U.S. alone, KIC serves over four million students at the top "brick and mortar" (non-online)
               colleges and universities. With the introduction of the KIC BookEdge, KIC Click, and KIC Click Mini,
               KIC is now affordable for virtually all institutions of higher learning and full-service public
               libraries. Last decade, libraries typically 'added' several KICs, but since 2010 libraries have begun to
               replace their entire patron-use copier fleets with self-serve book scanning systems.
           </p>

           <h2 class="brochure-title-center">A True Digital Age Multifunction System for Academic &amp; Public
               Libraries</h2>
           <img id="scan-diagram" src="../images/JPGs for KIC Click &amp; Click Mini Brochure/ScanDiagram.png" alt="">
           <h2>Book Scanning</h2>
           <p>
               Students at academic libraries want speed, and DLSG offers the fastest book scanners on the market.
               Patrons at public libraries need simplicity, and KIC provides three of the simplest possible user
               interfaces, one exclusively for scanning, one exclusively for copying and one exclusively for faxing.
               And KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.
           </p>
           <img id="copy-diagram" src="../images/JPGs for KIC Click &amp; Click Mini Brochure/CopyDiagram.png" alt="">
           <h2>Copier Replacement</h2>
           <p>
               While multifunction copiers are partly digital, they are big mechanical machines with big maintenance
               issues and tiny touch screens. As a copier replacement, KIC eliminates copier failure/service problems
               and provides very large touch screens and view screens that are larger still. Organizing (collating,
               clipping, rotating, etc.) pages on a huge touch screen is much easier than shuffling paper.
           </p>
           <p>
               The digital age has steadily driven down the demand in libraries for paper copies to levels that make
               it increasingly difficult to justify copiers. KIC self-service scanning systems reduce copier use
               further
               — to the point that attaching a small laser or ink jet printer is sufficient.
               <img id="fax-diagram" src="../images/JPGs for KIC Click &amp; Click Mini Brochure/FaxDiagram.png"
                    alt="">
               KIC systems also handle
               much larger materials than copiers, and they scan books without damaging them. However, the most
               compelling
               benefit of KIC over copiers is KIC's speed, due mainly to its face-up scanning design, which is not only
               significantly faster, but far easier to use.
           </p>
           <h2>Self-Serve Fax</h2>
           <p>
               KIC's huge touch screen and larger view screen make faxing extra easy. Users can compose, review, clip,
               crop and change brightness and contrast of the pages of a fax before sending. KIC's step-by-step process
               is
               designed for easy operation by even the most timid users. All you need is an internet connection, and
               DLSG
               will provide the rest at a cost so low that fax revenue can pay for the KIC system in a few years or
               less.

                        The KIC BookEdge is the perfect choice for student walk-up scanning and copying in areas where
                        space
                        is a premium. It makes entire library collections available in digital form. The KIC BookEdge's
                        clever design allows users to scan pages right up to the bound margin near the spine, without
                        damaging books. The KIC BookEdge produces beautiful, ful-color images at no additional cost over
                        black & white images! Even searchable PDF's and text-to-audio (MP3 files) are a snap to create.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The KIC BookEdge was specifically designed to occupy the same space as a typical floor-standing
                        photocopier. Replacing outmodded copiers in academic and research libraries is easy with KIC
                        BookEdge's modern scanning, printing and interactive computerized touch screen technology. The
                        optional ADF scanner and a printer gives the KIC BookEdge the functionality of a color copier at
                        a
                        fraction of the cost.

                        Digital copiers are very mature products that certainly have their place in business and
                        administration environments, but not the library floor. With its book edge feature that protects
                        the
                        spines of books, its ADF option that scans one or both sides of 20 loose-leaf pages per minute,
                        and
                        a generic high-speed printer, KIC gives new meaning to the phrase 'copiers are so old school.'
                        When
                        compared with copiers and MFC's, KIC book scanners are the only intelligent choice for the
                        library
                        floor.

            <p>Ease-of-use is a central feature of KIC. Its large, 22 inch touch screen and its large "Scan" and "Save,
                Send
                or Print" buttons that occupy a very large portion of the touch screen clearly convey how easy KIC is to
                use. The Save button defaults to an output method and file format that is selectable by the institution.
                If
                a flash drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it will save
                to
                the flash drive. Users can override the default output method by manually selecting one or more other
                methods of output.</p>
            <p>KIC Bookeye 4's high speed is derived as much from its ultra-simple, true two-touch interface as from its
                face-up design that obviates the need to flip books over and over again during the capture process.</p>

                height
                for wheelchair access. The KIC Bookeye 4 also offers an optional desktop configuration with a single 22"

                    digital world. DLSG offers improved software regularly, and
                    in order to make it easier to deploy updates, KIC Fleet Manager
                    lets you update KIC systems remotely. For example, a
                    recently released feature lets you turn KIC systems on and
                    off on demand or on a schedule set by a central control panel.
