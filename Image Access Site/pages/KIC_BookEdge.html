                    In the U.S. alone, KIC serves over four million students at the top "brick and mortar"
                    (non-online) colleges and universities. With the introduction of the KIC BookEdge, KIC Click,
                    and KIC Click Mini, KIC is now affordable for virtually all institutions of higher learning and
                    full-service public libraries. Last decade, libraries typically 'added' several KICs, but since
                    2010 libraries have begun to replace their entire patron-use copier fleets with self-serve book
                    scanning systems.

                        Students at academic libraries want speed, and DLSG offers the fastest book scanners on the
                        market. Patrons at public libraries need simplicity, and KIC provides three of the simplest
                        possible user interfaces, one exclusively for scanning, one exclusively for copying and one
                        exclusively for faxing. And KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.

                    <p class="common-text-p">
                        While multifunction copiers are partly digital, they are big mechanical machines with big
                        maintenance issues and tiny touch screens. As a copier replacement, KIC eliminates copier
                        failure/service problems and provides very large touch screens and view screens that are
                        larger still. Organizing (collating, clipping, rotating, etc.) pages on a huge touch screen
                        is much easier than shuffling paper.
                    </p>
                    <p class="common-text-p">
                        The digital age has steadily driven down the demand in libraries for paper copies to levels
                        that make it increasingly difficult to justify copiers. KIC self-service scanning systems
                        reduce copier use further &ndash; to the point that attaching a small laser or ink jet
                        printer is sufficient.

                        KIC systems also handle much larger materials than copiers, and they scan books without
                        damaging them. However, the most compelling benefit of KIC over copiers is KIC's speed, due
                        mainly to its face-up scanning design, which isnot only significantly faster, but far
                        easier to use.

                        KIC's huge touch screen and larger view screen make faxing extra easy. Users can compose,
                        review, clip, crop and change brightness and contrast of the pages of a fax before sending.
                        KIC's step-by-step process is designed for easy operation by even the most timid users. All
                        you need is an internet connection, and DLSG will provide the rest at a cost so low that fax
                        revenue can pay for the KIC system in a few years or less.

                    <p>
                        Thick books with stiff spines and content that runs deep into the bookfold are often damaged
                        when
                        copied. KIC BookEdge easily captures content well into the bookfold without damaging the spine.

                        The KIC BookEdge is the perfect choice for student walk-up scanning and copying in areas where
                        space
                        is a premium. It makes entire library collections available in digital form. The KIC BookEdge's
                        clever design allows users to scan pages right up to the bound margin near the spine, without
                        damaging books. The KIC BookEdge produces beautiful, ful-color images at no additional cost over
                        black & white images! Even searchable PDF's and text-to-audio (MP3 files) are a snap to create.

                        The KIC BookEdge was specifically designed to occupy the same space as a typical floor-standing
                        photocopier. Replacing outmodded copiers in academic and research libraries is easy with KIC
                        BookEdge's modern scanning, printing and interactive computerized touch screen technology. The
                        optional ADF scanner and a printer gives the KIC BookEdge the functionality of a color copier at
                        a
                        fraction of the cost.

                        the

                        <p>Ease-of-use is a central feature of KIC. The KIC BookEdge's large touch screen and its large
                            "Scan" and "Save, Send or Print" buttons that occupy a very large portion of the touch
                            screen
                            clearly convey how easy KIC is to use. The Save button defaults to an output method and file
                            format that is selectable by the institution. If a flash drive is inserted, KIC detects this
                            and the output button changes to indicate that it will save to the flash drive. Users can
                            override the default output method by manually selecting one or more alternative methods of
                            output.

                        phone makers relentlessly pursued
                        smaller
                        and smaller screens until very recently when one company reversed that trend. They realized that
                        people want
                        the largest screen that will fit in their pocket/purse and hand. This is because dis- play
                        screens are our window to the

                        with the low prices
                        for high quality displays, it is compelling to add a separate display screen. In 2002, DLSG
                        realized this, when the first
                        KIC system was designed. Today, with nearly 10 years more experience than any other vendor, DLSG
                        has the most under- standable,
                        easy to use and powerful user interface for self- serve book scanning, and it's based on dual
                        screens.

                            <p class="common-text-p row__column--custom">Since the first KIC was delivered
                                to an academic library in 2004, the days of photocopiers for patron use in academic
                                libraries and even public libraries were numbered. And now with the rapid explosion of
                                tablet computers and electronic readers, the demand in academic libraries for electronic
                                copies has substantially outstripped the demand for printed copies. The demand for
                                electronic copies in public libraries is also reaching a tipping point.
                            </p>
                            <p class="common-text-p row__column--custom">The ability to capture virtually
                                unlimited numbers of pages of research into a tablet or electronic reader and search

                                used just about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely valuable. In this digital
                                age, academic libraries are compelled to go hybrid for three reasons: 1) the high
                                demand for digital content; 2) their existing print collections contain vast amounts of
                                information that cannot be found on the Internet; and 3) students are receptive to the
                                price of electronic copies - typically free.

                            <p class="common-text-p row__column--custom">So how do the costs of KIC systems
                                compare with those of photo copiers? There are three main factors that keep the cost of
                                photocopies high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner and ink; 2) photocopiers require
                                a lot of maintenance due to the number of moving parts; and 3) all major photocopier
                                brands use a distributed service model.
                            </p>
                            <p class="infoblock__page-12__double__double-p common-text-p row__column--custom">
                                In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC because KIC has split the scan/copy
                                functions into three separate machines, choosing the best of breed for each. As a
                                result, KIC offers the best book scanners by themselves or with a loose-leaf paper
                                (ADF) scanner. Virtually any off-the-shelf laser or inkjet printer can be added to any
                                KIC system, so you can optimize costs and speeds, and offer affordable color.

                                copiers and with three black and white copiers. Both copiers are the kinds typically
                                seen in academic libraries. One KIC BookEdge is compared with three copiers because
                                its face-up operation yields well over two times the performance of a typical copier.
                                The costs are broken into three main areas: equipment and maintenance, consumables,
                                and patron usage time. With KIC, electronic output is assumed to be preferred over
                                print 90% of the time. That ratio has ranged from 75-95% electronic in 2012, but is
                                certain to rise in the future.

                            Over the years, many libraries experimented with color copiers, but could never find a
                            formula that worked. If the fees were low, patrons would copy materials with so much color
                            that the library would spend more on ink than the fees they were collecting. If the fees
                            were too high, the usage would be so low that the cost of the machine couldn't be justified.

                            KIC calculates the amount of color in an image before it is printed. So the fee for copies
                            with a little bit of color can be the same as the fee for black and white copies. If a copy
                            has a lot of color, the fee can be increased in proportion to the cost of the color ink or
                            toner. This wonderful feature should be a simple, easy byproduct of the digital age, and it
                            is with KIC.
