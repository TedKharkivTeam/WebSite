            <p>
                In the U.S. alone, KIC serves over four million students at the top "brick and mortar" (non-online)
                colleges and universities. With the introduction of the KIC BookEdge, KIC Click, and KIC Click Mini,
                KIC is now affordable for virtually all institutions of higher learning and full-service public
                libraries. Last decade, libraries typically 'added' several KICs, but since 2010 libraries have begun to
                replace their entire patron-use copier fleets with self-serve book scanning systems.

            <h2>Book Scanning</h2>
            <p>
                Students at academic libraries want speed, and DLSG offers the fastest book scanners on the market.
                Patrons at public libraries need simplicity, and KIC provides three of the simplest possible user
                interfaces, one exclusively for scanning, one exclusively for copying and one exclusively for faxing.
                And KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.
            </p>
            <img id="copy-diagram" src="../images/JPGs for KIC Click &amp; Click Mini Brochure/CopyDiagram.png" alt="">
            <h2>Copier Replacement</h2>
            <p>
                While multifunction copiers are partly digital, they are big mechanical machines with big maintenance
                issues and tiny touch screens. As a copier replacement, KIC eliminates copier failure/service problems
                and provides very large touch screens and view screens that are larger still. Organizing (collating,
                clipping, rotating, etc.) pages on a huge touch screen is much easier than shuffling paper.
            </p>
            <p>
                The digital age has steadily driven down the demand in libraries for paper copies to levels that make
                it increasingly difficult to justify copiers. KIC self-service scanning systems reduce copier use
                further
                — to the point that attaching a small laser or ink jet printer is sufficient.
                <img id="fax-diagram" src="../images/JPGs for KIC Click &amp; Click Mini Brochure/FaxDiagram.png"
                     alt="">
                KIC systems also handle
                much larger materials than copiers, and they scan books without damaging them. However, the most
                compelling
                benefit of KIC over copiers is KIC's speed, due mainly to its face-up scanning design, which is not only
                significantly faster, but far easier to use.
            </p>
            <h2>Self-Serve Fax</h2>
            <p>
                KIC's huge touch screen and larger view screen make faxing extra easy. Users can compose, review, clip,
                crop and change brightness and contrast of the pages of a fax before sending. KIC's step-by-step process
                is
                designed for easy operation by even the most timid users. All you need is an internet connection, and
                DLSG
                will provide the rest at a cost so low that fax revenue can pay for the KIC system in a few years or
                less.

                        The KIC BookEdge is the perfect choice for student walk-up scanning and copying in areas where
                        space
                        is a premium. It makes entire library collections available in digital form. The KIC BookEdge's
                        clever design allows users to scan pages right up to the bound margin near the spine, without
                        damaging books. The KIC BookEdge produces beautiful, ful-color images at no additional cost over
                        black & white images! Even searchable PDF's and text-to-audio (MP3 files) are a snap to create.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The KIC BookEdge was specifically designed to occupy the same space as a typical floor-standing
                        photocopier. Replacing outmodded copiers in academic and research libraries is easy with KIC
                        BookEdge's modern scanning, printing and interactive computerized touch screen technology. The
                        optional ADF scanner and a printer gives the KIC BookEdge the functionality of a color copier at
                        a
                        fraction of the cost.

                        Digital copiers are very mature products that certainly have their place in business and
                        administration environments, but not the library floor. With its book edge feature that protects
                        the
                        spines of books, its ADF option that scans one or both sides of 20 loose-leaf pages per minute,
                        and
                        a generic high-speed printer, KIC gives new meaning to the phrase 'copiers are so old school.'
                        When
                        compared with copiers and MFC's, KIC book scanners are the only intelligent choice for the
                        library

            <p>Ease-of-use is a central feature of KIC. Its large, 22 inch touch screen and its large "Scan" and "Save,
                Send
                or Print" buttons that occupy a very large portion of the touch screen clearly convey how easy KIC is to
                use. The Save button defaults to an output method and file format that is selectable by the institution.
                If
                a flash drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it will save
                to
                the flash drive. Users can override the default output method by manually selecting one or more other
                methods of output.</p>
            <p>KIC Bookeye 4's high speed is derived as much from its ultra-simple, true two-touch interface as from its
                face-up design that obviates the need to flip books over and over again during the capture process.</p>

                    it is important to know which KIC systems are
                    used the most and at what times during the
                    day and week, and which are used the least.
                    All usage statistics can help you to determine
                    the best KIC configuration for each site. And
                    to make it easier to navigate from KIC to KIC
                    system, KIC Fleet Manager allows you to select
                    a particular KIC system via either of two
                    methods: a map or a list. </p>

                    With over ten years serving libraries, KIC is the most stable
                    product available today. However, DLSG engineers incessantly
                    work to improve KIC and support the growing changing
                    digital world. DLSG offers improved software regularly, and
                    in order to make it easier to deploy updates, KIC Fleet Manager
                    lets you update KIC systems remotely. For example, a
                    recently released feature lets you turn KIC systems on and
                    off on demand or on a schedule set by a central control panel.

                            <p>Since the first KIC was delivered to an academic library in 2004, the days of photocopiers for
                                patron
                                use
                                in academic libraries and even public libraries were numbered. And now with the rapid explosion
                                of
                                tablet computers and electronic readers, the demand in academic libraries for electronic copies
                                has
                                substantially outstripped the de- mand for printed copies. The demand for electronic copies in
                                public
                                libraries is also reaching a tipping point.</p>
                            <p>The ability to capture virtually unlimited numbers of pages of research into a tablet or
                                electronic
                                reader and search through that material on the Internet with a tablet, eReader or notebook PC
                                that
                                can
                                be used just about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely valuable. In this digital age,
                                academic
                                libraries are compelled to go hybrid for three reasons: 1) the high demand for digital content;
                                2)
                                their
                                existing print collections contain vast amounts of information that cannot be found on the
                                Internet;
                                and
                                3) students are receptive to the price of electronic copies - typically free.</p>
                            <p>So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo copiers? There are three main
                                factors
                                that

                            <p>This graph compares the total costs of one color KIC Bookeye 4 system with three color copiers
                                and
                                with
                                three black and white copiers. Both copiers are the kinds typically seen in academic libraries.
                                One
                                KIC
                                Bookeye 4 is compared with three copiers because its face-up operation yields well over two

                                the
                                performance of a typical copier. The costs are broken into three main areas: equipment and
                                maintenance,
                                consumables, and patron usage time. With KIC, electronic output is assumed to be preferred over
                                print
                                90% of the time. That ratio has ranged from 75-95% electronic in 2012, but is certain to rise in

                            <p>Statistics from five million scanning sessions across America revealed a median session length of
                                23
                                pages.
                                So, most of the time spent during a KIC session is spent scanning.
                                Face up scanning has been proven to be three times faster than face down scanning.
                                So why is speed so important</p>
                            <ul class="blue-bullet">
                                <li>It's economical. One KIC Bookeye can replace multiple copiers or other face-down scanning

                        <p>
                            Over the years, many libraries experimented with color copiers, but could never find a formula
                            that
                            worked. If the fees were low, patrons would copy materials with so much color that the library
                            would
                            spend more on ink than the fees they were collecting. If the fees were too high, the usage would
                            be
                            so low that the cost of the machine couldn't be justified.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            KIC calculates the amount of color in an image before it is printed. So the fee for copies with
                            a
                            little bit of color can be the same as the fee for black and white copies. If a copy has a lot
                            of
                            color, the fee can be increased in proportion to the cost of the color ink or toner. This
                            wonderful
                            feature should be a simple, easy byproduct of the digital age, and it is with KIC.
