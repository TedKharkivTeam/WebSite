                    <p>Get into the game with Opus! Long have the complexity and high startup and operating costs of
                        digitization projects kept most libraries, museums and archives on the sidelines. Opus
                        leverages today's highperformance, low-cost computers to obliterate those barriers with its
                        paint-by-numbers digitization system that produces the highest quality digital collections
                        possible at less than 1/3 historic startup and operating costs. In as little as one day,
                        Digital Library Systems Group (DLSG) installation and training staff will leave you with a
                        fully operational digitization system. Followon training sessions via the Web ensure that
                        your staff is producing multiple beautiful digital books per day in no time, complete with
                        hierarchical metadata.</p>

                    <p>With the new low prices and high-performance of the latest book scanning hardware, complete
                        digitization labs are surprisingly affordable.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="a-new-era-in-digitization__columns">
                    <p>The digital archives that Opus creates can be accessed without proprietary software. Using
                        its Compose Collection and Create Collection capabilities, Opus can create an unlimited
                        number of digital collections in nearly unlimited formats (derivatives) any time in the
                        future. Simply select the desired volumes and data formats and let Opus create your
                        collection(s) unattended overnight.</p>

                    <p>Opus' automated data migration facility makes it easy to transfer multiple copies of your
                        digital archive to new media every three to five years, ensuring that no data is ever lost.
                        In addition, during data migration, Opus will automatically convert from outdated data
                        formats to any new standards that might emerge in the future.</p>

                        <p>The Define stage locks object-level metadata to each volume prior to scanning via a barcoded
                            tracking sheet that is kept with the volume. The scan operator simply scans the tracking
                            sheet,

                            in
                            a non-proprietary format. Whenever objects are output by the Compose and Create stages, the

                        <p>stage allows unlimited numbers of digital collections to be exported repeatedly with
                            different
                            image and metadata specifications. Each digital collection can include any number of objects

                <li><span>WorkFlow Manager</span>Opus WorkFlow Manager completely manages all
                    objects throughout the entire digitization process while allowing third party software to be used
                    where
                    desired; provides tools for monitoring all objects as they move through the digitization WorkFlow
                    system
                    to make managing projects and scheduling workers a breeze; and minimizes the cost of rework, whether
                    it
                    be skipped or improperly performed work, or even a change in the fundamental rules governing a
                    digitization project.
                </li>
                <li><span>Automatic and Manual Image Treatment</span>Opus completely automates
                    the Image Treatment processes by separating two-up images, removing bookfold distortion, fan,
                    gutter,
                    and skew; all in a single operation. Opus also provides a streamlined graphical interface to
                    manually
                    perform the specialized image treatment functions required for both digital preservation and the
                    various
                    types of access.
                </li>
                <li><span>Integrated Hierarchical Metadata Capture</span>Opus' Metadata
                    Capture stages are not part of any digital collection viewing software, but instead are built
                    seamlessly
                    into the Opus digitization WorkFlow system. The Opus Metadata Capture stages allow users to select
                    from
                    a list of standard hierarchical metadata templates, create new ones and restrict users to a subset
                    of
                    templates for a given project. The templates include metadata characteristics like requiring certain
                    metadata to be captured, allowing some types of metadata to be repeated and requiring a single value
                    for
                    other types.
                </li>
                <li><span>State-of-the-Art Customizable Output Derivatives and Formats</span>Opus'
                    Create Collection stage provides output thatcan be imported into open source and proprietary content
                    management and digital library systems. Storage and internet bandwidth requirements rise as image
                    quality rises. Opus lets the user select the ideal compromise for each access system that
                    collections
                    are deployed to. If requirements change, simply output the collection again with different clarity
                    parameters.

                <li>
                    <span>Automated Archival</span>Opus adheres to the Open RAID standard.
                    During the digitization process, there are three points at which archival is necessary: 1) archival
                    of
                    images immediately after scanning and before image treatment is performed; 2) archival of images
                    after
                    image treatment has been performed; and 3) archival of metadata after metadata has been captured.
                    Opus
                    creates archives that are open architecture in formats that are accessible by today's communities of
                    users, and with the proper data migration plan, will be accessible by its future communities of
                    users.
                </li>
                <li><span>Data Migration Facility</span>Opus provides an Archive Management
                    and Data Migration facility which is intended to be run periodically, before the possibility of any
                    media-related data loss becomes significant and before the media or data formats become obsolete.
                    Opus'
                    data migration facility runs unattended. While moving the data to new media, it can convert images
                    and/or metadata from its existing standardized formats to new standardized formats, ensuring that
                    data
                    is never lost and is always in a format that is accessible by its community of users.
                </li>
                <li><span>Digital Collection Web Site Creator</span>Opus provides Web-ready
                    output that allows viewers to select a volume, open it and navigate from section to section and from
                    page to page. A lifelike 3-D virtual page turning experience is provided as well. Opus creates the
                    image
                    files, downloadable PDFs, HTML, etc. including an entry point file called default. html and places
                    them
                    in a folder. To deploy a Web-ready digital collection, simply place the contents of the folder
                    created
                    by Opus on a Web site server and link the default.html file to an existing Web page. A thousand-book
                    collection can be deployed in little more than the time it takes to copy the data.
                </li>
                <li><span>Enlightened Architecture</span>The Opus architecture originates from
                    a clear understanding of the core purposes of each element of digitization and access systems. In

                    book publishing business, rarely are books manufactured in the stores that sell them. Not only is
                    manufacturing separate from retail, but distributors exist to attend to the specific needs of each
                    of
                    their stores while providing a simple, consolidated relationship with book manufacturers. In some
                    cases,
                    distributors provide warehousing services and in other cases, product warehousing is performed by
                    the
                    manufacturer. Opus serves as the manufacturer, warehouse and distributor.

            <p>Opus takes the tedium out of image treatment by providing users with an interface that is wholly
                dedicated to processing images for archive, preservation and access. Even problem images can be fully
                processed in seconds. Prior to manually reviewing and adjusting images, Opus performs image treatment
                functions automatically. If any automatic image treatment function requires additional adjustment, Opus
                allows the user to graphically 'assist' Opus and make adjustments in seconds.</p>

            <p>Automatic image treatment removes skew, adjusts the border, and eliminates fan and gutter. The treated
                image may be further refined by manual treatment.</p>

            <p>Opus' hierarchical metadata capture is controlled by templates that can be created and modified to fit
                virtually any requirements. Input field characteristics include: required/optional, repeatable/one
                occurrence only and other characteristics that can be specified when templates are constructed or
                modified.
                Opus provides several generic templates to capture the data necessary to create virtual library output

                <p>Opus provides a straightforward graphical interface for creating and modifying hierarchical
                    templates. The
                    templates carry the characteristics of XML elements and attributes. Data entry rules such as
                    required/optional and single/multiple can be assigned to each field. During metadata capture and
                    entry,
                    Opus
                    enforces the rules, thus simplifying metadata entry and reducing the possibility of errors.<br><br>
                    In
                    addition, the Opus hierarchical metadata input facility allows a user to scroll back and forth
