        <p>Image Access scanners are environmentally friendly, comply to the highest security standards and do not
            interfere with other devices. We have also made sure that no harmful radiation in the form of
            electromagnetic emission and UV or infrared light exists. Because these kinds of scanners are heavy
            production machines with inherent risks to the operator, no one should operate a scanner from a vendor who
            cannot provide at least an IEC/UL 60950 safety report.</p>
        <p>Image Access scanners conform to the many national and international standards which are listed below. Our
            scanners have been tested and certified by independent laboratories and we can also provide test reports of
            each standard on paper upon request.</p>
        <p><b>The Bookeye&reg; 4 V2 conforms to the following standards:</b></p>
