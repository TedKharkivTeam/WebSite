                <p>The Opus digitization process was designed specifically for academic libraries,
                    museums
                    and
                    archives. Use
                    Opus FreeFlow to build digital assets for preservation, archive, digital collections for the Web,
                    and
                    for
                    viewing software. Its image treatment processes such as fan, gutter and book curvature removal, and
                    content
                    location and registration, are dramatically faster and easier to use than photo editing
                    software.</p>

                <p class="">Opus FreeFlow operates a wide array of preservation quality scanners and allows for
                    the
                    import
                    of existing
                    images as well. It then groups images into objects (i.e. books), which are easily managed and
                    processed.
                    Finally, it renders those objects into a variety of derivatives.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text_block2_page1">
                <p>With Opus FreeFlow 3-tab interface, users can switch dynamically between scanning, image
                    treatment and
                    outputting derivatives. Multipage objects can be reopened and reprocessed at any time. Pages can be
                    deleted
                    and rescanned and new pages can be scanned and inserted. Unlimited derivatives can be created with
                    variations in image size, resolution, format and file type.</p>

                <p>Opus FreeFlow is fully compatible with Opus Digitization WorkFlow software. While objects
                    are
                    in the middle
                    of the Opus WorkFlow, they can be opened with Opus FreeFlow for additional scanning, image
                    modification
                    and
                    derivative generation.</p>

                        <p>The Define stage locks object-level metadata to each volume prior to scanning via a barcoded
                            tracking sheet that is kept with the volume. The scan operator simply scans the tracking
                            sheet,
                            then the volume. Metadata templates can also be selected in this stage.</p>

                            eliminate
                            book curve, fan and gutter, and smooth backgrounds. Opus Image treatment functions are not

                            quality and autoimage treatment results. Bad scans are flagged for rescan, and image
                            treatment

                        <p>The Automatic metadata capture stage captures metadata that was specified in the metadata
                            template, stores it in a nonproprietary XML format and passes it to the Manual Metadata
                            Entry

                            specified in the object's template, from object level to page and sub-page level, with an
                            unlimited number of elements at each hierarchical level.</p>

                        <p>The third and final Opus Archive stage automatically archives the captured and keyed metadata
                            in
                            a non-proprietary format. Whenever objects are output by the Compose and Create stages, the

                        <p>stage allows unlimited numbers of digital collections to be exported repeatedly with
                            different
                            image and metadata specifications. Each digital collection can include any number of objects
                            from the archive. Format, size, clarity and metadata can vary widely.</p>

                        <p>This stage provides unattended output of entire digital collections comprising many volumes.
                            Since image resizing, etc. can be very time intensive, this stage can be performed
                            overnight.</p>

                <li><span>WorkFlow Manager</span>Opus WorkFlow Manager completely manages all
                    objects throughout the entire digitization process while allowing third party software to be used
                    where
                    desired; provides tools for monitoring all objects as they move through the digitization WorkFlow
                    system
                    to make managing projects and scheduling workers a breeze; and minimizes the cost of rework, whether
                    it
                    be skipped or improperly performed work, or even a change in the fundamental rules governing a
                    digitization project.
                </li>
                <li><span>Automatic and Manual Image Treatment</span>Opus completely automates
                    the Image Treatment processes by separating two-up images, removing bookfold distortion, fan,
                    gutter,
                    and skew; all in a single operation. Opus also provides a streamlined graphical interface to
                    manually
                    perform the specialized image treatment functions required for both digital preservation and the
                    various
                    types of access.
                </li>
                <li><span>Integrated Hierarchical Metadata Capture</span>Opus' Metadata
                    Capture stages are not part of any digital collection viewing software, but instead are built
                    seamlessly
                    into the Opus digitization WorkFlow system. The Opus Metadata Capture stages allow users to select
                    from
                    a list of standard hierarchical metadata templates, create new ones and restrict users to a subset
                    of
                    templates for a given project. The templates include metadata characteristics like requiring certain
                    metadata to be captured, allowing some types of metadata to be repeated and requiring a single value
                    for
                    other types.
                </li>
                <li><span>State-of-the-Art Customizable Output Derivatives and Formats</span>Opus'
                    Create Collection stage provides output thatcan be imported into open source and proprietary content
                    management and digital library systems. Storage and internet bandwidth requirements rise as image
                    quality rises. Opus lets the user select the ideal compromise for each access system that
                    collections
                    are deployed to. If requirements change, simply output the collection again with different clarity
                    parameters.

                <li>
                    <span>Automated Archival</span>Opus adheres to the Open RAID standard.
                    During the digitization process, there are three points at which archival is necessary: 1) archival
                    of
                    images immediately after scanning and before image treatment is performed; 2) archival of images
                    after
                    image treatment has been performed; and 3) archival of metadata after metadata has been captured.
                    Opus
                    creates archives that are open architecture in formats that are accessible by today's communities of
                    users, and with the proper data migration plan, will be accessible by its future communities of
                    users.
                </li>
                <li><span>Data Migration Facility</span>Opus provides an Archive Management
                    and Data Migration facility which is intended to be run periodically, before the possibility of any
                    media-related data loss becomes significant and before the media or data formats become obsolete.
                    Opus'
                    data migration facility runs unattended. While moving the data to new media, it can convert images
                    and/or metadata from its existing standardized formats to new standardized formats, ensuring that
                    data
                    is never lost and is always in a format that is accessible by its community of users.
                </li>
                <li><span>Digital Collection Web Site Creator</span>Opus provides Web-ready
                    output that allows viewers to select a volume, open it and navigate from section to section and from
                    page to page. A lifelike 3-D virtual page turning experience is provided as well. Opus creates the
                    image
                    files, downloadable PDFs, HTML, etc. including an entry point file called default. html and places
                    them
                    in a folder. To deploy a Web-ready digital collection, simply place the contents of the folder
                    created
                    by Opus on a Web site server and link the default.html file to an existing Web page. A thousand-book
                    collection can be deployed in little more than the time it takes to copy the data.
                </li>
                <li><span>Enlightened Architecture</span>The Opus architecture originates from
                    a clear understanding of the core purposes of each element of digitization and access systems. In
                    the
                    book publishing business, rarely are books manufactured in the stores that sell them. Not only is
                    manufacturing separate from retail, but distributors exist to attend to the specific needs of each
                    of
                    their stores while providing a simple, consolidated relationship with book manufacturers. In some
                    cases,
                    distributors provide warehousing services and in other cases, product warehousing is performed by
                    the
                    manufacturer. Opus serves as the manufacturer, warehouse and distributor.

            <p>Opus takes the tedium out of image treatment by providing users with an interface that is wholly
                dedicated to processing images for archive, preservation and access. Even problem images can be fully
                processed in seconds. Prior to manually reviewing and adjusting images, Opus performs image treatment
                functions automatically. If any automatic image treatment function requires additional adjustment, Opus
                allows the user to graphically 'assist' Opus and make adjustments in seconds.</p>
            <img src="../images/JPGs of Opus Workflow Brochure/Three_Pages.png" width="1766" height="629" alt="opus">

            <p>Automatic image treatment removes skew, adjusts the border, and eliminates fan and gutter. The treated
                image may be further refined by manual treatment.</p>
            <img src="../images/JPGs of Opus Workflow Brochure/Two_Pages.png" width="1642" height="299" alt="opus">

            <p>Book curvature produced from scanning tightly bound books may be realigned using Opus' sophisticated book
                curve correction tool. Text and photos are returned to their original alignment and orientation.</p>

            <p>Opus allows for the output of a large variety of derivatives. Controlling threshhold optimizes the
                clarity for each type of derivative which, in turn, produces the highest quality image for that output
                request.</p>

                <p>Opus support for the Open Archive Initiative (OAI) takes
                    on several forms. Opus has the ability to generate export derivative sets
                    which can be added into an OAI-compliant metadata repository and made available
                    via the OAI-PMH to any OAI compliant metadata harvesters. The DLSG operates
                    and manages the cloud infrastructure necessary to support this need, thus
                    freeing our users from having to acquire and maintain the expertise to
                    make their chosen objects available to the digital archive community at large.
                    For example, this feature of Opus allows its users to easily contribute to the
                    Digital Public Library Project (DPLA) with just a few clicks.</p>

                <p>Published objects can be further queried and made available

            <p class="OAI5_Software">Opus' hierarchical metadata capture is controlled by templates that can be created
                and modified to fit virtually any requirements. Input field characteristics include
                :required/optional, repeatable/one occurrence only and other characteristicsc
                that can be specified when templates are constructed of modified. Opus provides several
                generic templates to capture the data necessary to create virtual library output formats.</p>

            <div class="block_hierarchical_metadata">
                <p class="block_hierarchical_metadata_table">Opus provides a straightforward graphical interface for
                    creating and modifying hierarchical templates. The templates carry the charasterics
                    of XML elements and attributes. Data entry rules such as required/optional and
                    single/multiple can be assigned to each field. During metadata capture and entry,
                    Opus enforces the rules, thus simplifying metadata entry and reducing errors.</p>

                    <p>One of the key benefits of the Opus Metadata capture system
                        is its flexibility in allowing project curators to not only design and codify
                        their own specialized metadata data capture needs, but to link these metadata collection
                        sets to customized object meronomies. This degree of metadata capture
                        task standardization affords the project's curator the confidence to
                        know that their project's metadata needs will be meet by the data collection4
                        team.</p>

                    <p>Once these completed metadata collection templates have
                        been defined , they can be shared back into curator's community,
                        thus allowing the project to expand beyond a single institute. This ensures
                        that the resultant aggregate of objects can be blended seamlessly together
                        into a single master archive to be used by the project's curators to
                        publish their collective work as part of a single repository.</p>
