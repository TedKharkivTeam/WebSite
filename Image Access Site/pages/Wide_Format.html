                <h3>WideTEK&reg; 36 - Quiet & compact wide format color scanner for documents up to 36 inch widths</h3>

                <p>WideTEK® 36 scans documents up to 36 inches wide (915mm). It is quiet and compact, making it ideal
                    for applications in any office or production environment.It is the fastest high end color scanner
                    with three CCD cameras.
                    State of the art illumination using bright white LEDs guarantees long lifetime and a low cost of
                    ownership, since there are practically no consumables necessary over the life of the product.
                    Cutting edge camera technology, with a dust-protected, fully sealed camera box holding CCD systems
                    that use a patented stitching procedure, delivers up to 1200 dpi scanner resolution.</p>

                    <p>Three ultra high resolution wide gamut CCD cameras produce up to 600dpi brilliant scans. The cameras are housed in a sealed, dust proof container and need no mechanical adjustment over their lifetime. Color output, including ICC profiling, is done in native, sRGB or Adobe RGB modes.</p>
                    <p>The Scan2Net&reg; technology is the underlying technological platform for controlling Scan2Net&reg; devices. All parameters are available in a clearly structured interface. Minimized scan time combined with multipurpose data output increases the efficiency of document scanning.</p>

                <h3>WideTEK&reg; 36DS - Wide Format Duplex Scanner for documents to 36 Inches (915 mm) Wide </h3>
                <p>WideTEK&reg; 36DS - the world´s first wide format duplex scanner for digitization of two sided printed documents up to 36 inches (915 mm) in width. At a resolution of 300 dpi the scanner needs only 2.5 seconds to scan the front and back sides of a newspaper page in a single pass through the scanner.</p>
                <p>The idea of double sided scanning in one production step primarily means less production effort: The document no longer needs to be flipped over and scanned again on the other side. That makes the scanner an ideal companion for press clipping, archiving and library services.</p>
                <p>The scanner is equipped with two processor units. This allows an extremely fast data throughput. The patented stitching procedure merges the images of the cameras seamlessly together. The scanner resolution of 1200 dpi guarantees brilliant scan results.</p>

    <!--<h2>Wide Format Scanners</h2>-->
    <!--<h3>Years of Experience Developing Excellence</h3>-->
    <!--<p> The WideTEK<sup>&reg;</sup> family of wide format scanners proves that experience and excellence go hand in-->
    <!--hand. The history of the WideTEK<sup>&reg;</sup> brand of large format scanners manufactured by Image Access-->
    <!--began more than 13 years ago, with the development of the first A2 color flatbed scanner FBA2. As the first-->
    <!--scanner of its kind, the WideTEK FBA2 was equipped with the innovative Scan2Net<sup>&reg;</sup> Technology-->
    <!--from Image Access. </p>-->
    <!--<p> This groundbreaking innovation enabled the world´s first communication with the scanner purely via a TCP/IP-->
    <!--network interface. No additional hardware or interface cards, driver installations and configurations were-->
    <!--required. Likewise, operating a Scan2Net<sup>&reg;</sup> scannner was completely independent of the-->
    <!--operating system. This technology also made the following generations of scanners unique and served as a-->
    <!--purchasing decision advantage around the world. </p>-->
    <!--<p> Based on Scan2Net<sup>&reg;</sup> and the experience Image Access gained through the manufacture of the-->
    <!--FBA2; in 2004, the first large format sheetfed scanners were presented. With scan widths up to 48 inches,-->
    <!--Image Access had developed and could market truly professional, quality wide format scanners, branded as the-->
    <!--WideTEK<sup>&reg;</sup> family of scanners. </p>-->
    <!--<p> High resolution, color fidelity and especially superior scanning speeds helped the WideTEK<sup>&reg;</sup>-->
    <!--family of scanners quickly become established leaders in the wide format market. </p>-->
    <!--<p> Since beginning production of the Bookeye<sup>&reg;</sup> overhead scanners in 1997 and then the-->
    <!--WideTEK<sup>&reg;</sup> family of scanners in 2000, Image Access has since become the only manufacturer that-->
    <!--covers the market segments overhead, sheetfeed and flatbed scanners with its products. </p>-->
    <!--<p> In 2008, Image Access made the largest product launch in its history, with the introduction of the wide-->
    <!--format family of scanners WideTEK<sup>&reg;</sup> 25, WideTEK<sup>&reg;</sup> 36, WideTEK<sup>&reg;</sup> 42-->
    <!--and WideTEK<sup>&reg;</sup> 48 &#45;&#45; four technologically superior new products. With scan widths of 25, 36, 42-->
    <!--and 48 inches, the family offers solutions for scanning all formats from A2 to A0. </p>-->
    <!--<p>Higher resolution at faster scan speeds, as well as standalone operation via a touchscreen display are only-->
    <!--three of the unique features of this generation of scanners.</p>-->
    <!--<p> Particular attention was paid to maintenance components. WideTEK<sup>&reg;</sup> scanners are all equipped-->
    <!--with a maintenance free LED illumination and a dust protected camera box.</p>-->
    <!--<p>In 2009, Image Access developed the world´s first wide format duplex scanner for double-sided documents up to-->
    <!--36 inches. The compact WideTEK 36DS needs only four seconds to scan the front and back of a newspaper page-->
    <!--in a single pass through the scanner. To date this is the only wide format duplex scanner in the world. And-->
    <!--it is a real benefit to customers working in the media control or newspaper archiving businesses.</p>-->
    <!--<p> In 2011, the WideTEK <sup>&reg;</sup> family grew again, now including the WideTEK 36C, the first CIS-->
    <!--scanner which reaches the scanning speed and quality of a CCD scanner and by far the fastest CIS scanner-->
    <!--worldwide. We hope you will follow us to see what innovative new products Image Access will bring to the-->
    <!--market next.</p>-->
    <!--<h3>All WideTEK<sup>&reg;</sup> scanners are CE, UL, cUL, WEEE, RoHS and Energy Star compliant.</h3>-->
