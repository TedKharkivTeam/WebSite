        <div class="infoblock__content">
            <p>A fundamental tenet that has always bound the academic
                research community together is open sharing of newfound
                knowledge. Today, this open sharing is going on at a feverish
                pace and digital interlibrary loan services are an essential vehicle.
                Scholars from all fields are becoming increasingly dependent on
                their ability to acquire journal articles in just one day.</p>
            <p>In the early 1990s, the pioneers of interlibrary loan digitization
                had no choice but to adapt commercial scanning equipment to
                meet their needs. Ariel was the only available document delivery
                software and there were no scanners made specifically for
                scanning books, journals and maps. Over time, that changed.
                Planetary scanners became available in the late 1990s. The ﬁrst
                release of BSCAN ILL automatically read (using OCR) the
                requestor information from pull slips without manual keying,
                supported rapid scanning and image cleanup, and automatically
                posted to Ariel with the press of a single button. Since then,
                lLLiad, Odyssey, Ariel, RAPID, Clio and Article Exchange have
                been integrated into BSCAN ILL with the same hands-off
                automation. BSCAN ILL has a host of valuable features, many of
                which are not available with any other system.</p>

        <div class="infoblock__content">
            <p>In addition to allowing review of electronic articles and resource
                sharing to reduce per article scanning costs (e.g. for archival.

                    placing the book, the user simply turns pages and presses
                    the scan button (or foot pedal) to scan two pages at a time.</p>
