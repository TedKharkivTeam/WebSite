        <!--<h2>KIC Bookeye vs. Copiers &ndash; How KIC Compares</h2>-->
        <!--<h3>Copiers are Outmoded</h3>-->
        <!--<p>Since the first KIC was delivered to an academic library in 2004, the days of photocopiers for patron use in-->
            <!--academic libraries and even public libraries were numbered.-->
            <!--And now with the rapid explosion of tablet computers and electronic readers, the demand in academic-->
            <!--libraries-->
            <!--for electronic copies has substantially outstripped the de- mand for printed copies.-->
            <!--The demand for electronic copies in public libraries is also reaching a tipping point. The ability to-->
            <!--capture-->
            <!--virtually unlimited numbers of pages of research into a tablet or electronic reader and search through that-->
            <!--material on the Internet with a tablet, eReader or notebook PC that can be used just about anywhere is-->
            <!--highly-->
            <!--convenient and immensely valuable.-->
            <!--In this digital age, academic libraries are compelled to go hybrid for three reasons: 1) the high demand for-->
            <!--digital content; 2) their existing print collections contain vast amounts of information that cannot be-->
            <!--found on-->
            <!--the Internet; and 3) students are receptive to the price of electronic copies &ndash; typically free.-->
            <!--So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo copiers?-->
            <!--There are three main factors that keep the cost of photo- copies high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner-->
            <!--and-->
            <!--ink; 2) photo- copiers require a lot of maintenance due to the number of moving parts; and 3) all major-->
            <!--photocopier brands use a distributed service model.-->
            <!--In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC because KIC has split the scan/copy functions into three separate-->
            <!--machines, choosing the best of breed for each. As a result, KIC offers the best book scanners by themselves-->
            <!--or-->
            <!--with a loose-leaf paper (ADF) scanner.-->
            <!--Virtually any off-the-shelf laser or inkjet printer can be added to any KIC system, so you can optimize-->
            <!--costs-->
            <!--and speeds, and offer affordable color.</p>-->
        <!--<img src="../images/Dlsg/KIC/Click_Page9_Printer.png" width="278" height="247">-->
        <!--<h3>No More Book Spine Damage!</h3>-->
        <!--<p>Thick books with stiff spines and content that runs deep into the bookfold are often damaged when copied. KIC-->
            <!--Bookeye 4 easily captures content without damaging book spines.-->
            <!--KIC automatically removes black edges, straightens content, and produces clean, professional looking-->
            <!--images &ndash; important for electronic reserves, course curriculum materials and research reports. These-->
            <!--automatic image-->
            <!--treatment functions also save a lot of administrator, faculty, and student time.</p>-->
        <!--<img src="../images/Dlsg/KIC/Click_Page8_RedSign.png" width="278" height="247">-->
        <!--<h3>Thick Books...No Problem</h3>-->
        <!--<p><i>KIC Bookeye 4 handles thick books beautifully. Its contourfinding laser allows it-->
            <!--to flatten even the most curved books-->
            <!--and produce text that is clear and undistorted. KIC automatically adds margins for print-ready image-->
            <!--quality.</i></p>-->
        <!--<h3>KIC Bookeye 4 Scanners vs. Copiers</h3>-->
        <!--<p>This graph compares the total costs of one color KIC Bookeye 4 system with three color copiers and with three-->
            <!--black and white copiers. Both copiers are the kinds typically seen in academic libraries.-->
            <!--One KIC Bookeye 4 is compared with three copiers because its face-up operation yields well over two times-->
            <!--the-->
            <!--perfor- mance of a typical copier.-->
            <!--The costs are broken into three main areas: equipment and maintenance, consumables, and patron usage time.-->
            <!--With-->
            <!--KIC, electronic output is assumed to be preferred over print 90% of the time.-->
            <!--That ratio has ranged from 75-95% electronic in 2012, but is certain to rise in the </p>-->

        <!--<h3>KIC Bookeye Scans 3 Times Faster</h3>-->
        <!--<p>Statistics from five million scanning sessions across America revealed a median session length of 23 pages.-->
            <!--So, most of the time spent during a KIC session is spent scanning.-->
            <!--Face up scanning has been proven to be three times faster than face down scanning.-->
            <!--So why is speed so important?</p>-->
        <!--<ul>-->
            <!--<li>It's economical. One KIC Bookeye can replace multiple copiers or other face-down scanning machines.</li>-->
            <!--<li>It gives patrons another reason to visit your library.</li>-->
            <!--<li>It's green. The faster it is, the more use it will get and the less the copier will be used.</li>-->
        <!--</ul>-->
        <!--<h3>Color Images are Free</h3>-->
        <!--<p>In the digital world, there is no paper, toner or ink, so libraries rarely charge for images, whether black-->
            <!--and-->
            <!--white or color.</p>-->
        <!--<h3>Color Copies for Less</h3>-->
        <!--<p>Over the years, many libraries experimented with color copiers, but could never find a formula that worked.-->
            <!--If the fees were low, patrons would copy materials with so much color that the library would spend more on-->
            <!--ink-->
            <!--than the fees they were collecting.-->
            <!--If the fees were too high, the usage would be so low that the cost of the machine couldn't be justified.-->
            <!--KIC calculates the amount of color in an image before it is printed.-->
            <!--So the fee for copies with a little bit of color can be the same as the fee for black and white copies. If a-->
            <!--copy has a lot of color, the fee can be increased in proportion to the cost of the color ink or toner.-->
            <!--This wonderful feature should be a simple, easy byproduct of the digital age, and it is with KIC.</p>-->
