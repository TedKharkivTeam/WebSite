                    Most libraries have a lot of volumes that haven't been checked out in a long time, and libraries
                    certainly can increase their relevance in the digital age by adding collaboration and study spaces.
                    So it is rather compelling to cull books from the library.

                    The main argument against culling/moving books off-site is the unknown, but potentially great value
                    that your unabridged collection can have in inciting the very uncommon, but equally special epiphany
                    that a researcher can have while browsing the stacks and perusing the very books that are targeted

                    If your need to repurpose a lot of stacks space outweighs the value of keeping your full collection
                    browsable, then before you proceed with the culling, let DLSG photograph your entire collection as
                    it is today and make it browsable with KAT stacks view. Students abd researchers can browse your
                    complete collection virtually, instantly see any book's bibliography by touching its spine, and with
                    another touch, read books that have been digitized.
