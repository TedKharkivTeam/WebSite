                    BSCAN Standard constitutes a stand-alone capture system or the scanning stage in a multi-stage
                    capture
                    system. BSCAN Standard is available in four capacities: Personal, Low, Medium and High Volume.

                <p class="width-seventy-percent">
                    BSCAN's powerful customizations are among its greatest assets. Build sophisticated WorkFlows with
                    custom
                    screens, commands, key entry windows, mouse-based image processing functions and more.

                    BSCAN's user-friendly controls offer multiple, pre-defined screen layouts to choose
                    from, with maximum image clarity for easy QC, or, for maximum efficiency user interfaces,
                    build your own custom screen layouts that support only the functions you choose.

                <h2 class="paragraph-title-left">Setup Wizard</h2>
                <p>
                    With BSCAN's Wizard, setting up a simple, single scan and release station or a
                    complex WorkFlow system with unlimited stations is a snap. Select from a list of
                    sample capture WorkFlow templates or build several of your own. The Wizard
                    will walk you through a step-by-step configuration process. Conversion
                    bureaus can build their own special tricks into BSCAN applications and install
                    them as WorkFlow templates that can be used to set up new projects.

                <h2 class="paragraph-title-left">Project Administration</h2>
                <p>
                    BSCAN's multiple-project administration facilities are ideal for
                    Conversion Bureaus. Easily navigate through applications and
                    stages. Set up automatic application selection kist for automatic
                    processing as well as manual stations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Automated processing PCs work unattended, checking an
                    unlimited number of projects for work to do. Manual processing
                    stations can automatically check for unfinished work, showing
                    only the work for which a given worker is authorized.

                <span class="title">Control Sheets</span>
                <br>BSCAN control sheets allow users to select the scanning application, the scanner settings,
                image processing, document separation and auto-indexing. While these settings can be made
                by the scan operator, the control sheet allows the scanner operator to focus on maximizing throughput
                and quality. Hours of document preparation can be quickly reviewed before scanning to eliminate errors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img id="white-pages" src="../images/Business_Automation_Scanning/WhitePages.png" alt=""/>
                When they can be used, the barcodes on the control sheets are the most efficient
                and accurate way to index the images scanned. For example, with backfile conversions, basic information
                about each file folder is usually in a database. By creating
                a list file of that basic information, sorted in the order the folders are stored in the
                cabinets, BSCAN can print a control sheet for each folder that will automatically
                index that folder if it is placed at the beginning of the start of the document pages in the folder.
                During document preparation, the next page in the stack of folder control sheets
                should always match the folder pulled from the cabinet to be prepared for scanning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, while scanning or as post-process, the scan station can perform image
                processing functions such as Rotation, Crop & Deskew, Despeckle, Border
                Removal, Blank Page Deletion and Color Dropout.
            </p>

            <span class="paragraph-title-left">Application Selection Control Sheet</span>
            <p>
                Place application selection control sheets on top of each batch of pages to be
                scanned to ensure that documents are not scanned into the wrong application.
            </p>
            <span class="paragraph-title-left">General Purpose Control Sheet</span>
            <p>
                Set scanner parameters, select image format, turn image processing such as
                rotation on and off, identify the start of new documents and folders and attach
                database records to the pages following these general purpose control sheets. They also
                contain a 10 digit mark sense field for specifying field values during document preparation.
            </p>
            <span class="paragraph-title-left">Document Type Control Sheet</span>
            <p>
                Use these control sheet to separate documents and identify document type. Print control sheets with
                all common document types and
                BSCAN will apply the text or code of the marked document type to the document following the control
                sheet. By including a special type:
                <span class="button_special">[] Other</span> and space for hand printing the document code and
                name, only
                the most common document separator sheets need be printed,
                reducing the number of control sheet bins for the various document types.
            </p>

            <span class="title">Image Processing</span>
            <p>
                Image Processing can be performed on each image as it is scanned or after scanning. In addition to the
                usual image
                processing functions such as rotate, crop and deskew, despectle and border removal, tests can be enabled
                that automatically check for signs of
                bad images such as text dropout and a high degree of skew. Images are automatically flagged for review
                and reprocessing without a scanner or
                when necessary, for rescanning.
            </p>
            <span class="title">Rescan</span>
            <p>
                During QC, if it is determined that rescanning is needed, such as when a page was scanned with the
                corner folded, the image can be
                flagged for rescan. During the Rescan stage, each flagged image is presented for rescan with information
                displayed to help locate the original page.
            </p>
            <span class="title">Forms Processing</span>
            <p>
                OCR, Barcode Recognition, ICR and Mark Sense are performed here to automatically recognize and extract
                data from
                forms. The captured data is then populated into user specified fields for review/correction. High speed
                correction of suspect characters can be
                performed to improve accuracy.
            </p>
            <span class="title">Key Entry</span>
            <p>
                Key entry can be performed on a separate BSCAN-DE station or on the BSCAN scan station with extra
                licensing. Key verify
                and auto-zoom by field are some of BSCAN's many data entry capabilities.
            </p>
            <span class="title">Review and Correct</span>
            <p>
                At this stage captured data can be reviewed and corrected.
            </p>
            <span class="title">Release</span>
            <p>
                After scanning, cleanup and indexing, BSCAN can release images and index information to third-party
                imaging software, directly to SQL
                server, to a directory structure or to an ASCII file. BSCAN Standard can create a selection of PDF file
                formats while scanning.
