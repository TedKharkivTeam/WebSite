                <h3>Bookeye 4 V3</h3>
                <p>With this new member of the Bookeye&reg; family, Image Access placed an emphasis on developing a
                    scanner
                    which is compact, easy to operate and competitively priced; to bring high end professional scanning
                    to an
                    even larger population of users. The efficient Bookeye&reg; 4 V3 digitizes source material such as
                    bound
                    documents at high speeds in up to 400 dpi optical resolution and formats up to DIN A3.</p>
                <p>Over 17 years of electronic, optical and mechanical engineering experience went into the creation and
                    manufacture of the Bookeye&reg; 4 models. The clever mirror mechanism captures the document
                    precisely from
                    edge to edge, whether it is a flat document or a book open at an angle of 120 degrees.</p>
                <p>The V-shaped book cradle was optimized to reduce the risk of damage to book spines and binding during
                    digitization. The book cradle holds the open book at an angle of 120 degrees; enough to effectively
                    scan the
                    contents of a page, while gently preserving the original subject matter.</p>

                <h3>KIC Click & Click Mini</h3>
                <p>The KIC Click is a high-speed, face-up book capture system at an affordable price. Its sleek and
                    elegant look will complement any library floor. And with its True2TouchTM user interface, KIC Click
                    is as easy to use as it is beautiful. Are there any compromises? You decide.</p>
                <p>The KIC Click captures nearly 20 book pages per minute for instant access on tablets, notebooks,
                    smart devices and easy transfer to desktop PCs and servers. With a bed size 30% larger than its
                    nearest competitor, it captures up to 22 x16 inch books and materials at an uncompromising
                    resolution of 300dpi.</p>
                <p>Photocopiers, PCs, monitors and keyboards clutter up otherwise beautiful libraries across America.
                    The smooth but rugged black or white KIC Clicks totally reverse that trend, adding beauty to even
                    the most beautiful libraries.</p>

                <h3>KIC Bookedge</h3>
                <p>The days of the photo copier on the library floor are over. Students demand digital, and your print
                    collections are too valuable not to make them available to the majority of college students today
                    who see copiers as
                    "old school."</p>
                <p>Occupying less space than a floor standing copier and offering 12x17 inch book-edge scanning, KIC
                    BookEdge provides the next best thing to face-up scanning in a form factor that's small enough to
                    fit in the far corners of any library! And its cost is small too.</p>
                <p>But don't let its size fool you. KIC BookEdge systems provide the same extensive capabilities as our
                    heavy duty KIC systems: fast scan/copy/fax/print, image editing and collating, save to tablets,
                    smart phones, notebook PCs, USB drives, and Cloud, send via email or FTP.</p>
