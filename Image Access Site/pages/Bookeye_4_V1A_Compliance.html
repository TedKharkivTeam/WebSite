        <p>Image Access scanners are environmentally friendly, comply to the highest security standards and do not
            interfere with other devices. We have also made sure that no harmful radiation in the form of
            electromagnetic emission and UV or infrared light exists. Because these kinds of scanners are heavy
            production machines with inherent risks to the operator, no one should operate a scanner from a vendor
            who cannot provide at least an IEC/UL 60950 safety report.</p>
        <p>Image Access scanners conform to the many national and international standards which are listed below.
            Our scanners have been tested and certified by independent laboratories and we can also provide test
            reports of each standard on paper upon request.</p>
        <p><b>The Bookeye&reg; 4 V1A conforms to the following standards:</b></p>
