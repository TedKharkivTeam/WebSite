        <h2>Glossary of Technical Terms</h2>
        <h3>The following is a glossary of scanning related technical terminology.</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>8 bit grayscale</b> contains 256 possible shades of gray.</li>
            <li><b>24 bit color </b>contains a possible 16 million distinct colors. This method of scanning produces the
                largest file size.
            </li>
            <li><b>32 bit color</b> contains a possible 16 million distinct colors as with 24 bit color and the other
                eight bits are used as a separate layer for representing levels of translucency in an object or image.
            </li>
            <li><b>Bitmap </b>provides a way to store a binary image, that is, an image in which each pixel is either
                black or white (or any two colors).
            </li>
            <li><b>Color depth</b> is the number of&nbsp;bits&nbsp;used to indicate the&nbsp;color&nbsp;of a single&nbsp;pixel&nbsp;in
                a&nbsp;bitmapped&nbsp;image. (See 8 bit grayscale, 24 bit color and 32 bit color above).
            </li>
            <li><b>Crop</b> refers to removing excess information that is surrounding an image of the original document
                but is not part of the image, like a white border.
            </li>
            <li><b>Deskew</b> is the ability of a scanner to detect that the item being scanned is not straight and to
                realign the scanned image to be straight.
            </li>
            <li><b>DPI (dots per inch)</b>, the number of&nbsp;pixels&nbsp;per&nbsp;inch&nbsp;used in an image and
                determines the resolution of the image. See also resolution.
            </li>
            <li><b>Duplex</b> indicates two sided documents. A duplex scanner will scan both sides of a document at the
                same time.
            </li>
            <li><b>Enhanced halftone</b> is a conversion of a multitonal image to a bitonal image in such a way that the
                impression of a mulitonal image is retained.
            </li>
            <li><b>Footprint</b> represents the length and width dimensions of the scanner, indicating how much space is
                required for the device.
            </li>
            <li><b>JPEG (jpg) </b>stands for&nbsp;Joint Photographic Experts Group, the committee that created the JPEG
                standard. It defines how an image is compressed into a stream of&nbsp;bytes&nbsp;and decompressed back
                to an image.
            </li>
            <li><b>Mbit/s (megabits per second)</b> â€“ the number of bits of data that are transferred per second. 1
                megabit = 1,000,000 bits.
            </li>
            <li><b>OCR (Optical Character Recognition)</b> is electronic&nbsp;conversion of scanned&nbsp;images&nbsp;of
                handwritten, typewritten or printed text into machine-encoded text.
            </li>
            <li><b>PDF (Portable Document Format)</b> is an open file format created by Adobe in 1993 and is an accepted
                standard for digital file sharing.
            </li>
            <li><b>Resolution</b> is degree&nbsp;of fineness with which an image can be recorded or produced, often
                expressed as the number of&nbsp;pixels&nbsp;per unit of length (typically an&nbsp;inch).
            </li>
            <li><b>Scan2Net<sup>&reg;</sup></b>&nbsp;technology provides a code-free client via any web browser for all
                Image Access scanners. Scan2Net<sup>&reg;</sup> frees the host PC from all image related and time
                critical tasks. Read more about this technology in the whitepaper on our website.

            </li>
            <li><b>TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)</b> is a storage format widely supported by image manipulation
                software applications.
