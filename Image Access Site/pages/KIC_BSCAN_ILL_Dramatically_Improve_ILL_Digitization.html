            A fundamental tenet that has always bound the
            academic research community together is open sharing
            of newfound knowledge. Today, this open sharing
            is going on at a feverish pace and digital interlibrary
            loan services are an important vehicle. Scholars from
            all ﬁelds are becoming increasingly dependent on
            their ability to acquire journal articles in just one day.
            <br>
            In the early 1990s, the pioneers of interlibrary loan
            digitization had no choice but to adapt commercial
            scanning equipment to meet their needs. Ariel was the
            only available document delivery software and there
        </span>
        <span class="page3__inline">
            were no scanners made speciﬁcally for scanning books,
            journals and maps. Over time, that changed. Planetary
            scanners became available in the late 1990s. The ﬁrst
            release of BSCAN ILL automatically read (using OCR)
            the requestor information from pull slips without manual
            keying, supported rapid scanning and image cleanup,
            and automatically posted to Ariel with the press of a single
            button. Since then, |LLiad, Odyssey, Ariel, RAPID, Clio
            and Article Exchange have been integrated into BSCAN
            ILL with the same hands-off automation. Today, BSCAN
            ILL has a host of valuable features, many of which are not
            available with any other system.

                    to use a face-down scanner to scan multiple pages.

                <p>In contrast, the sequence on the left shows the relative
                    speed and ease of face-up scanning systems that do not
                    require the user to ﬂip over the book being scanned. Once
                    placing the book, the user simply turns pages and presses
                    the scan button (or foot pedal) to scan two pages at a time.</p>
