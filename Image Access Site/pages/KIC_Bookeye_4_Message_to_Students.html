            <h2>The Hybrid Library</h2>
            <h3 style="font-style: italic;">A message to students</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Higher education libraries across America hold $100 Billion in scholarly knowledge, the majority of
                    which can't be found on the internet. This knowledge has been amassed through careful selection over
                    many years and is augmented at substantial expense every year. And, thanks to U.S. copyright law,
                    this knowledge is <strong>free</strong> to scan an unlimited number of times, or until books
                    disintegrate.</p>
                <p>Because of this, hundreds of universities across America have added high-speed self-serve book
                    scanning machines to their library floors; machines that create digital content at rates of 5 to 20
                    pages per minute. These self-serve Knowledge Imaging Centers are much gentler on books and produce
                    higher-quality digital content than the paper reprints produced by paper copiers. The image can cost
                    as little as 1&cent; per page and are readable on tablets & smart phones as well as
                    notebooks and regular PCs. The images can be printed at any time for those who still prefer hard
                    copy.</p>
                <section>
                    <h3>What can be done?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Fortunately, academic libraries exist to serve students. The first step is for students to
                            inform
                            the libraries as to just how important it is to switch from paper copiers to digital book
                            scanners
                            that can print if desired. The next step depends on circumstances at your particular
                            institution. Every year, libraries
                            spend many times more money on printed books and journals than the cost of an entire fleet
                            of new
                            high-speed scanners. But some libraries have no control over any of that budget money. At
                            these institutions,
                            faculty specifies what is purchased. So, the library must use other funds to purchase these
                            units.
                            If yours is such an institution, it is especially important to convey just how much students
                            value getting unlimited,
                            free digital content from their libraries, and that it's worth the effort to scrape together
                            the necessary funds from various other budgets.</p>
                        <p>Another means of acquiring KIC systems is to use student-administered funds (i.e. student
                            technology
                            funds). These non-library funds can be used to purchase a pilot set of one small KIC, one
                            medium KIC and one
                            large KIC. Once they're in the library, their popularity with students will make it much
                            easier to
                            justify all the efforts necessary to piece together the funds and to tell the entrenched
                            copier companies
                            that the library floor is no longer their domain.</p>
                        <p>Alternately a relatively small portion of these funds can be used to upgrade from basic
                            copier
                            replacement Knowledge Imaging Centers that scan 5 pages per minute to faster KIC systems
                            that scan up to 20 pages per minute.</p>

                    <h3>Should copier companies determine how one of your university's great resources is to be

                    <div>
                        <p>Should copier companies determine how one of your university's great resources is to be used?
                            That is just what is happening in many universities. If your students want to go digital
                            (digitize on demand),
                            you may have to take it up with the university department that negotiated a campus-wide
                            contract
                            with a copier company and ask that the library floors be excerpted from the contract
                            because:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                                            When people see the new KIC Click&trade; or Click Mini for the first time,
                                            the most common expression is "it's so beautiful."
                                            And with True2Touch, it's as easy to use as it is beautiful. Our new and
                                            exciting Click Mini book scanner achieves a far more affordable

                                            The KIC Click&trade; captures book content as fast as 1 page per second!
                                            With a bed size 30% larger than its nearest competitor, it captures up to
                                            21x16 inch books and materials at an uncompromising resolution of 300dpi.

                                            The KIC Click Mini captures 30 book pages per minute! It produces sharp,
                                            clear images in full color at 300dpi for instant
                                            access on tablets, notebooks, smart devices and easy transfer to desktop PCs
                                            and servers. Its 12.25 x 19.2 inch bed size
                                            is significantly larger than double-letter and is large enough for most book
                                            pages. Very large books can be scanned one
                                            page at a time sideways and the images rotated. And of course, it handles
                                            loose paper and other flat material, too.

                                            libraries across America.
                                            The smooth, triple-layer, pearlescent white KIC Click&trade; totally
                                            reverses that trend.
                                            It adds beauty to the most beautiful libraries.
                                            Inspired by an outstanding effort of the fledgling tablet industry to turn
                                            technology into something more like jewelry or a fashion accessory than a
                                            computer, the pearlescent KIC Click&trade; evokes comments like, "We care
                                            about the appearance of our library and this machine is over the top!"

                                        <p>
                                            The KIC Click&trade; and Click Mini perfectly complete the KIC family of
                                            self-serve digitizing systems.
                                            The KIC Bookeye 4 has the most durable production book scanner, the only
                                            book scanner with both V-cradle and flat modes, and the highest quality
                                            600dpi of any scanner.
                                            The KIC Clicks are small, fast and beautiful, and the KIC BookEdge is
                                            cheaper than most floor standing black-and-white photocopiers.
                                            And since none of them use toner or paper, they're environmentally friendly
                                            and ultimately far cheaper to run than copiers.

                                            Unlike copiers and flatbed scanners, both KIC Click&trade; and Click Mini
                                            allow
                                            users to digitize books face-up, without damaging books by having to press
                                            them
                                            hard against a glass plate.
                                            The Click&trade;'s / Click Mini's lightening speed is derived as much from
                                            its
                                            fast opto-electronics as from the fact that its face-up design obviates the
                                            need
                                            to flip books over and over again during the digitization process.

                                            The Click&trade; and Click Mini produce beautiful, full-color images at no
                                            additional cost over black &amp; white images!
                                            Searchable PDF's and editable text files are a snap to create.
                                            As with all KIC self-serve systems, scanner's text-to-speech capability
                                            produces
                                            audio files that can be played in any MP3 player.
