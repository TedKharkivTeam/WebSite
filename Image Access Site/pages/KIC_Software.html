                    magazines and very large journals. It also has the additional
                    benefit of obviating the need for conventional photocopy machines. Excerpts from a printed volume
                    can be
                    digitized thousands of times with no additional
                    payments to publishers because KIC is digitize on demand, a welcome alternative to cost-prohibitive
                    born-digital subscriptions!
                    <!----->
                    KIC offers models for every budget and every need. KIC systems are available for use with a wide
                    variety
                    of scanners and digitizers ranging 25x18" scan area
                    with preservation to 11x17", very high-speed scan stations that provide instant access on tablets,
                    notebooks, smart devices and easy transfer to desktop PCs
                    and servers. All KIC scan stations are ruggedly built for high-volume use and designed specifically
                    for
                    gentle treatment of books, and KIC's searchable PDF
                    output files can be sent to email, USB drive, Cloud and/or sent wirelessly to smart devices. It's no
                    wonder that DLSG's products are now accessible to
                    over 60% of U.S. university students and faculty.</p>

            <p>
                In the U.S. alone, KIC serves over four million students at the top "brick and mortar" (non-online)
                colleges and universities. With the introduction of the KIC BookEdge, KIC Click, and KIC Click Mini,
                KIC is now affordable for virtually all institutions of higher learning and full-service public
                libraries. Last decade, libraries typically 'added' several KICs, but since 2010 libraries have begun to
                replace their entire patron-use copier fleets with self-serve book scanning systems.

            <h3 class="brochure-subtitle-left"> Book Scanning</h3>
            <p>
                Students at academic libraries want speed, and DLSG offers the fastest book scanners on the market.
                Patrons at public libraries need simplicity, and KIC provides three of the simplest possible user
                interfaces, one exclusively for scanning, one exclusively for copying and one exclusively for faxing.
                And KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.
            </p>
            <img class="copy-diagram" src="../images/brochure-pictures/TriangularCopy.png" alt="">
            <h3 class="brochure-subtitle-left">Copier Replacement</h3>
            <p>
                While multifunction copiers are partly digital, they are big mechanical machines with big maintenance
                issues and tiny touch screens. As a copier replacement, KIC eliminates copier failure/service problems
                and provides very large touch screens and view screens that are larger still. Organizing (collating,
                clipping, rotating, etc.) pages on a huge touch screen is much easier than shuffling paper.
            </p>
            <p>
                The digital age has steadily driven down the demand in libraries for paper copies to levels that make
                it increasingly difficult to justify copiers. KIC self-service scanning systems reduce copier use
                further
                — to the point that attaching a small laser or ink jet printer is sufficient.
                <img id="fax-diagram" src="../images/brochure-pictures/TriangularFax.png"
                     alt="">
                KIC systems also handle
                much larger materials than copiers, and they scan books without damaging them. However, the most
                compelling
                benefit of KIC over copiers is KIC's speed, due mainly to its face-up scanning design, which is not only
                significantly faster, but far easier to use.
            </p>
            <h3 class="brochure-subtitle-left">Self-Serve Fax</h3>
            <p>
                KIC's huge touch screen and larger view screen make faxing extra easy. Users can compose, review, clip,
                crop and change brightness and contrast of the pages of a fax before sending. KIC's step-by-step process
                is
                designed for easy operation by even the most timid users. All you need is an internet connection, and
                DLSG
                will provide the rest at a cost so low that fax revenue can pay for the KIC system in a few years or
                less.

                        time
                        and reduce book spine damage because they capture two face-up pages of a book with each scan and
                        do
                        not require the user to flip the book twice for each page. KIC analyzes each image, and
                        automatically splits it into two separate images. In addition, black edges are automatically
                        removed
                        and the content is straightened, producing clean, professional looking images - important for
                        electronic reserves, course curriculum materials and research reports. These automatic image
                        treatment functions also save a lot of faculty, administrator, and student time.</p>

                <div class="wrap-two-large-screens">
                    <p>It's easy to undervalue screen size. For 20 years, all cellphone makers relentlessly pursued
                        smaller
                        and smaller screens until very recently when one company reversed that trend. They realized that
                        people want the largest screen that will fit in their pocket/purse and hand. This is because
                        display
                        screens are our window to the digital world, and touch screens give us control over that
                        world.</p>
                    <p>As big as self-serve scanning systems are, it makes sense to have a very large touch screen. And
                        with
                        the low prices for high quality displays, it is compelling to add a separate display screen. In
                        2002, DLSG realized this, when the first KIC system was designed. Today, with nearly 10 years
                        more
                        experience than any other vendor, DLSG has the most understandable, easy to use and powerful
                        user
                        interface for self-serve book scanning, and it's based on dual screens.</p>
                    <p>The view screen shows very large, clear images of what you-vw scanned, allowing the touch screen
                        to
                        have big, easy to understand buttons and other controls.</p>
                    <p class="border">Display screens are our portals into the digital world, and touch screens are
                        the easiest way to
                        control that world. That's why DLSG provides large, 24 inch, full HD displays and equally large
                        touch screens with most of its KIC systems.<i

                        <p class="paragraph-pb">Since the first KIC was delivered to an academic library in 2004, the days of photocopiers
                            for
                            patron
                            use
                            in academic libraries and even public libraries were numbered. And now with the rapid
                            explosion
                            of
                            tablet computers and electronic readers, the demand in academic libraries for electronic
                            copies
                            has
                            substantially outstripped the demand for printed copies. The demand for electronic copies
                            in
                            public
                            libraries is also reaching a tipping point.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph-pb">The ability to capture virtually unlimited numbers of pages of research into a tablet or
                            electronic
                            reader and search through that material on the Internet with a tablet, eReader or notebook

                            be used just about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely valuable. In this digital
                            age,
                            academic
                            libraries are compelled to go hybrid for three reasons: 1) the high demand for digital
                            content;
                            2)
                            their
                            existing print collections contain vast amounts of information that cannot be found on the
                            Internet;
                            and
                            3) students are receptive to the price of electronic copies - typically free.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph-pb">So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo copiers? There are three main
                            factors
                            that
                            keep the cost of photo- copies high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner and ink; 2) photo-
                            copiers
                            require a lot of maintenance due to the number of moving parts; and 3) all major photocopier
                            brands
                            use
                            a distributed service model.</p>
                        <p class="infoblock__double__double-p resize">
                            In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC because KIC
                            has
                            split
                            the
                            scan/copy functions into three
                            separate machines, choosing the best of breed for each. As a result, KIC offers the best
                            book
                            scanners
                            by themselves or with a loose-leaf paper (ADF) scanner. Virtually any off-the-shelf laser or
                            inkjet
                            printer can be added to any KIC system, so you can optimize costs and speeds, and offer
                            affordable
                            color.

                        <p>This graph compares the total costs of one color KIC Bookeye 4 system with three color
                            copiers
                            and
                            with
                            three black and white copiers. Both copiers are the kinds typically seen in academic
                            libraries.
                            One
                            KIC
                            Bookeye 4 is compared with three copiers because its face-up operation yields well over two
                            times
                            the
                            performance of a typical copier. The costs are broken into three main areas: equipment and
                            maintenance,
                            consumables, and patron usage time. With KIC, electronic output is assumed to be preferred
                            over
                            print
                            90% of the time. That ratio has ranged from 75-95% electronic in 2012, but is certain to

                            library
                            would
                            spend more on ink than the fees they were collecting. If the fees were too high, the usage
                            would
                            be
                            so low that the cost of the machine couldn't be justified.

                        <p>
                            KIC calculates the amount of color in an image before it is printed. So the fee for copies
                            with
                            a
                            little bit of color can be the same as the fee for black and white copies. If a copy has a
                            lot
                            of
                            color, the fee can be increased in proportion to the cost of the color ink or toner. This
                            wonderful
                            feature should be a simple, easy byproduct of the digital age, and it is with KIC.

                scanning
                system are typically 1/3 the speed of face-up systems. The book flipping
                necessary to scan a book on a face-down scanner like the KIC BookEdge
                is shown in the photo sequence below. It's a workout both for the book
                and the patron. </p>
            <p class="infoblock__page-5__text-block">The ergonomic design of the face-up scanning systems
                involves only the basic movement required to set a book down and turn a page.</p>
            <p class="infoblock__page-5__dvfu3">Face-up book scanning is far easier on both
                patrons and books and quite a bit faster than face-down scanning.</p>
            <p>Scanning books face-up makes it much easier to keep track
                of what pages you've scanned.With KIC Click, Click Mini and other face-up scanners,
                books stay face up, so you can see what you're scanning as
                you scan it. This extra visibility eliminates the age old problem
                of skipping pages and scanning pages out of order which can occur
                with face-down scanners.</p>
