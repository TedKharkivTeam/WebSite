                <h2>Bookeye</h2>
                <p>KIC Bookeye 4 is an indispensable tool for research, study and production
                    of enhanced quality reports and papers with crystal clear color and black
                    & white excerpts from books, magazines and very large journals. In addition,
                    as a UDSA compliant digitize-on-demand system conveniently located among the
                    stacks, KIC can be used as an ad hoc digitization station by Interlibrary
                    Loan departments.</p>

                <h2>Click & Click Mini</h2>
                <p>Students at academic libraries want speed, and DLSG offers the fastest book
                    scanners on the market. Patrons at public libraries need simplicity, and KIC
                    provides three of the simplest possible user interfaces, one exclusively for
                    scanning, one exclusively for copying and one exclusively for faxing. And
                    KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.</p>

                <h2>BookEdge</h2>
                <p>The days of the photo copier on the library floor are over. Students
                    demand digital, and your print collections are too valuable not to make
                    them available to the majority of college students today who see copiers
                    as "old school."</p>
