                The KIC Click is a high-speed, face-up book capture system at an affordable price.
                Its sleek and elegant look will complement any library floor. And with its True2TouchTM user
                interface, KIC Click is as easy to use as it is beautiful. Are there any compromises? You decide.

                <p>
                    The KIC Click captures nearly 20 book pages per minute for instant access on tablets,
                    notebooks, smart devices and easy transfer to desktop PCs and servers. With a bed size 30% larger
                    than its nearest competitor, it captures up to 22 x16 inch books and materials at an uncompromising
                    resolution of 300dpi.

                    Photocopiers, PCs, monitors and keyboards clutter up otherwise beautiful libraries across America.
                    The smooth but rugged black or white KIC Clicks totally reverse that trend, adding beauty to even
                    the most beautiful libraries.

            <p>
                In the U.S. alone, KIC serves over four million students at the top "brick and mortar" (non-online)
                colleges and universities. With the introduction of the KIC BookEdge, KIC Click, and KIC Click Mini,
                KIC is now affordable for virtually all institutions of higher learning and full-service public
                libraries. Last decade, libraries typically 'added' several KICs, but since 2010 libraries have begun to
                replace their entire patron-use copier fleets with self-serve book scanning systems.

                Academic & Public

            <img id="scan-diagram" src="../images/brochure-pictures/TriangularScan.png" alt="Common device connection">
            <h3 class="text--left">Book Scanning</h3>
            <p>
                Students at academic libraries want speed, and DLSG offers the fastest book scanners on the market.
                Patrons at public libraries need simplicity, and KIC provides three of the simplest possible user
                interfaces, one exclusively for scanning, one exclusively for copying and one exclusively for faxing.
                And KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.
            </p>
            <img id="copy-diagram" src="../images/brochure-pictures/TriangularCopy.png" alt="Copier Replacement">
            <h3 class="text--left">Copier Replacement</h3>
            <p>
                While multifunction copiers are partly digital, they are big mechanical machines with big maintenance
                issues and tiny touch screens. As a copier replacement, KIC eliminates copier failure/service problems
                and provides very large touch screens and view screens that are larger still. Organizing (collating,
                clipping, rotating, etc.) pages on a huge touch screen is much easier than shuffling paper.
            </p>
            <p>
                The digital age has steadily driven down the demand in libraries for paper copies to levels that make
                it increasingly difficult to justify copiers. KIC self-service scanning systems reduce copier use
                further
                — to the point that attaching a small laser or ink jet printer is sufficient.
                <img id="fax-diagram" src="../images/brochure-pictures/Fax-Internet-Click.png" alt="Self-Serve Fax"/>
                KIC systems also handle
                much larger materials than copiers, and they scan books without damaging them. However, the most
                compelling
                benefit of KIC over copiers is KIC's speed, due mainly to its face-up scanning design, which is not only
                significantly faster, but far easier to use.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text--left">Self-Serve Fax</h3>
            <p>
                KIC's huge touch screen and larger view screen make faxing extra easy. Users can compose, review, clip,
                crop and change brightness and contrast of the pages of a fax before sending. KIC's step-by-step process
                is
                designed for easy operation by even the most timid users. All you need is an internet connection, and
                DLSG
                will provide the rest at a cost so low that fax revenue can pay for the KIC system in a few years or
                less.

                <p>
                    Printing copies and faxing have per page costs that normally must be passed on to the user. KIC has
                    a
                    free,
                    built-in method of charging users for copies and faxes.

                    late
                    book returns.

                <p class="dvfu3">Face-up book scanning is far easier on both
                    patrons and books and quite a bit faster than face-down scanning.</p>
                <p>Scanning books face-up makes it much easier to keep track
                    of what pages you've scanned. Click Mini and other face-up scanners,
                    books stay face up, so you can see what you're scanning as
                    you scan it. This extra visibility eliminates the age old problem
                    of skipping pages and scanning pages out of order which can occur
                    with face-down scanners.</p>

                <p>The following photo sequences show the reason that face-down scanning
                    system are typically 1/3 the speed of face-up systems. The book flipping
                    necessary to scan a book on a face-down scanner like the KIC BookEdge
                    is shown in the photo sequence below. It's a workout both for the book
                    and the patron.</p>

                    is to
                    use. The Save button defaults to an output method and file format that is selectable by the
                    institution.
                    If
                    a flash drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it

            <p class="large-screens-paragraph-one">It’s easy to undervalue screen size. For 20 years, all cellphone
                makers relentlessly pursued smaller
                and smaller screens until very recently when one company reversed that trend. They realized that
                people want the largest screen that will ﬁ t in their pocket/purse and hand. This is because display
                screens are our window to the digital world, and touch screens give us control over that world.</p>
            <p class="large-screens-paragraph-two">As big as self-serve scanning systems are, it makes sense to have
                a very large touch screen. And with
                the low prices for high quality displays, it is compelling to add a separate display screen. In
                2002, DLSG realized this, when the ﬁrst KIC system was designed. Today, with nearly 10 years more
                experience than any other vendor, DLSG has the most understandable, easy to use and powerful user
                interface for self-serve book scanning, and it’s based on dual screens.</p>
            <p>The view screen shows very large, clear images of what you’ve scanned, allowing the touch screen to
                have big, easy to understand buttons and other controls.</p>

                screens are our portals into the digital world,

                easiest way to
                control that world. That’s why DLSG provides large, 24 inch, full HD displays and equally large

                    it is important to know which KIC systems are
                    used the most and at what times during the
                    day and week, and which are used the least.
                    All usage statistics can help you to determine
                    the best KIC configuration for each site. And
                    to make it easier to navigate from KIC to KIC
                    system, KIC Fleet Manager allows you to select
                    a particular KIC system via either of two

                    With over ten years serving libraries, KIC is the most stable
                    product available today. However, DLSG engineers incessantly
                    work to improve KIC and support the growing changing
                    digital world. DLSG offers improved software regularly, and
                    in order to make it easier to deploy updates, KIC Fleet Manager
                    lets you update KIC systems remotely. For example, a
                    recently released feature lets you turn KIC systems on and
                    off on demand or on a schedule set by a central control panel.

                        <p class="paragraph-pb">Since the first KIC was delivered to an academic library in 2004, the
                            days of photocopiers
                            for
                            patron
                            use
                            in academic libraries and even public libraries were numbered. And now with the rapid
                            explosion
                            of
                            tablet computers and electronic readers, the demand in academic libraries for electronic
                            copies
                            has
                            substantially outstripped the demand for printed copies. The demand for electronic copies
                            in
                            public
                            libraries is also reaching a tipping point.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph-pb">The ability to capture virtually unlimited numbers of pages of research
                            into a tablet or
                            electronic
                            reader and search through that material on the Internet with a tablet, eReader or notebook

                            that
                            can
                            be used just about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely valuable. In this digital
                            age,
                            academic
                            libraries are compelled to go hybrid for three reasons: 1) the high demand for digital
                            content;
                            2)
                            their
                            existing print collections contain vast amounts of information that cannot be found on the
                            Internet;
                            and
                            3) students are receptive to the price of electronic copies - typically free.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph-pb">So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo copiers?
                            There are three main
                            factors
                            that
                            keep the cost of photo- copies high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner and ink; 2) photo-
                            copiers
                            require a lot of maintenance due to the number of moving parts; and 3) all major photocopier
                            brands
                            use
                            a distributed service model.</p>
                        <p class="infoblock__double__double-p">In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC because KIC
                            has
                            split
                            the
                            scan/copy functions into three
                            separate machines, choosing the best of breed for each. As a result, KIC offers the best
                            book
                            scanners
                            by themselves or with a loose-leaf paper (ADF) scanner. Virtually any off-the-shelf laser or
                            inkjet
                            printer can be added to any KIC system, so you can optimize costs and speeds, and offer
                            affordable
                            color.</p>

                        <p>This graph compares the total costs of one color KIC Click system with two color copiers
                            and
                            with
                            two black and white copiers. Both copiers are the kinds typically seen in academic
                            libraries.
                            One
                            KIC
                            Click is compared with two copiers because its face-up operation yields well over two
                            times
                            the
                            performance of a typical copier. The costs are broken into three main areas: equipment and
                            maintenance,
                            consumables, and patron usage time. With KIC Click, electronic output is assumed to be
                            preferred
                            over
                            print
                            90% of the time. That ratio has ranged from 75-95% electronic in 2012, but is certain to
                            rise in
                            the

                        <p>Statistics from five million scanning sessions across America revealed a median session
                            length of
                            23
                            pages.
                            So, most of the time spent during a KIC session is spent scanning.
                            Face up scanning has been proven to be three times faster than face down scanning.
                            So why is speed so important</p>

                    <p class="paragraph-pb">
                        Over the years, many libraries experimented with color copiers, but could never find a formula
                        that
                        worked. If the fees were low, patrons would copy materials with so much color that the library
                        would
                        spend more on ink than the fees they were collecting. If the fees were too high, the usage would
                        be
                        so low that the cost of the machine couldn't be justified.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        KIC calculates the amount of color in an image before it is printed. So the fee for copies with
                        a
                        little bit of color can be the same as the fee for black and white copies. If a copy has a lot
                        of
                        color, the fee can be increased in proportion to the cost of the color ink or toner. This
                        wonderful
                        feature should be a simple, easy byproduct of the digital age, and it is with KIC.
