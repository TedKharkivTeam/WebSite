                    <h3 class="brochure-subtitle-center">Copiers are Outmoded</h3>
                    <p>Since the first KIC was delivered to an academic library in 2004, the days of photocopiers for
                        patron
                        use
                        in academic libraries and even public libraries were numbered. And now with the rapid explosion
                        of
                        tablet computers and electronic readers, the demand in academic libraries for electronic copies
                        has
                        substantially outstripped the de- mand for printed copies. The demand for electronic copies in
                        public
                        libraries is also reaching a tipping point.</p>
                    <p>The ability to capture virtually unlimited numbers of pages of research into a tablet or
                        electronic
                        reader and search through that material on the Internet with a tablet, eReader or notebook PC
                        that
                        can
                        be used just about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely valuable. In this digital age,
                        academic
                        libraries are compelled to go hybrid for three reasons: 1) the high demand for digital content;
                        2)
                        their
                        existing print collections contain vast amounts of information that cannot be found on the
                        Internet;
                        and
                        3) students are receptive to the price of electronic copies - typically free.</p>
                    <p>So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo copiers? There are three main
                        factors
                        that
                        keep the cost of photo- copies high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner and ink; 2) photo-
                        copiers
                        require a lot of maintenance due to the number of moving parts; and 3) all major photocopier
                        brands
                        use
                        a distributed service model.</p>
                    <p class="infoblock__double__double-p">In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC because KIC has
                        split
                        the
                        scan/copy functions into three
                        separate machines, choosing the best of breed for each. As a result, KIC offers the best book
                        scanners
                        by themselves or with a loose-leaf paper (ADF) scanner. Virtually any off-the-shelf laser or
                        inkjet
                        printer can be added to any KIC system, so you can optimize costs and speeds, and offer
                        affordable
                        color.</p>

                    <p>This graph compares the total costs of one color KIC Bookeye 4 system with three color copiers
                        and
                        with
                        three black and white copiers. Both copiers are the kinds typically seen in academic libraries.
                        One
                        KIC
                        Bookeye 4 is compared with three copiers because its face-up operation yields well over two
                        times
                        the
                        performance of a typical copier. The costs are broken into three main areas: equipment and
                        maintenance,
                        consumables, and patron usage time. With KIC, electronic output is assumed to be preferred over
                        print
                        90% of the time. That ratio has ranged from 75-95% electronic in 2012, but is certain to rise in
                        the
                        future</p>

                    <p>Statistics from five million scanning sessions across America revealed a median session length of
                        23
                        pages.
                        So, most of the time spent during a KIC session is spent scanning.
                        Face up scanning has been proven to be three times faster than face down scanning.
                        So why is speed so important</p>
                    <ul class="blue-bullet">
                        <li>It's economical. One KIC Bookeye can replace multiple copiers or other face-down scanning
                            machines.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Over the years, many libraries experimented with color copiers, but could never find a formula
                    that
                    worked. If the fees were low, patrons would copy materials with so much color that the library
                    would
                    spend more on ink than the fees they were collecting. If the fees were too high, the usage would
                    be
                    so low that the cost of the machine couldn't be justified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    KIC calculates the amount of color in an image before it is printed. So the fee for copies with
                    a
                    little bit of color can be the same as the fee for black and white copies. If a copy has a lot
                    of
                    color, the fee can be increased in proportion to the cost of the color ink or toner. This
                    wonderful
                    feature should be a simple, easy byproduct of the digital age, and it is with KIC.
