                <p>Ease-of-use is a central feature of KIC. The KIC Click's large touch screen and its large "Scan"
                    and "Save, Send or Print" buttons that occupy a very large portion of the touch screen clearly
                    convey how easy KIC is to
                    use. The Save button defaults to
                    an output method and file format that is selectable by the institution. If a flash drive is
                    inserted, KIC detects this and the
                    output button changes to indicate that it will save to the flash drive. Users can override the
                    default output method by manually
                    selecting one or more alternative methods of output.</p>

                            <p>KIC is very agile, and allows the user to jump from just about anywhere in the touch
                                screen system to just about anywhere else, directly and usually with a single touch.
                                This
                                modern, 'modeless' design is easier to use, but difficult to create.</p>

                            <p>KIC's large buttons and controls are easy to use, even for people with unsteady

                            <p>KIC gradually expands and contracts controls such as brightness, con- trast and DPI
                                so users can easliy follow their screen activity</p>

                            <p>KIC doesn't delete original images when you clip a photo or excerpt of text unless

                            <p>Once you've scanned a document, you can change your mind as to where you would like
                                it to output. For example, you
                                may have wanted to save to USB, but learned your USB drive is full. Or you may scan
                                so much that it exceeds your email
                                limit. Or after scanning and collating a mass of research, you decide that you want
                                to share the research with others.</p>

            <div class="true2_block_2">
                <p>It's easy to undervalue screen size. For 20 years, all cell- phone makers relentlessly pursued
                    smaller
                    and smaller screens until very recently when one company reversed that trend. They realized that
                    people want
                    the largest screen that will fit in their pocket/purse and hand. This is because dis- play
                    screens are our window to the
                    digital world, and touch screens give us control over that world.</p>
                <p>As big as self-serve scanning systems are, it makes sense to have a very large touch screen. And
                    with the low prices
                    for high quality displays, it is compelling to add a separate display screen. In 2002, DLSG
                    realized this, when the first
                    KIC system was designed. Today, with nearly 10 years more experience than any other vendor, DLSG
                    has the most under- standable,
                    easy to use and powerful user interface for self- serve book scanning, and it's based on dual
                    screens.</p>
                <p>The view screen shows very large, clear images of what you've scanned, allowing the touch screen
                    to have big,
                    easy to understand buttons and other controls.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="true2_block_3">Display screens are our portals into the digital world, and touch
                screens are the easiest way to control that world.
                That's why DLSG provides large, 24 inch, full HD displays and equally large touch screens with
                most of its KIC systems.</p>
