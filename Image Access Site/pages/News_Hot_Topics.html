                    <span class="popup-article__header">St. Paul, MN</span>
                <p>Julie Kimlinger posted in the UST Libraries Blog the news from InterLibrary Loan Coordinator Faith Bonitz about the arrival of the new "dream scanner".</p>
                <p>"The BSCAN software automates many of the steps of scanning, sending, and updating of the lending article requests that we fill. First,
                    it can read the pick slip, and choose the correct method of transmission, grabbing needed ILL and transaction numbers for OCLC and ILLiad.
                    It can also read and enter Ariel, Odyssey, and email addresses, and patron names. After we scan the article, the software can automatically
                    de-skew crooked pages, correct for book curvature, and clean up the margins, so there are no black borders and fingers in the scan. It scans
                    two pages at a time, but separates the one scan into two images. Additionally, by means of ILLiad's Odyssey Helper, BSCAN can update the requests
                    in ILLiad/OCLC to "shipped," as it sends the article via Ariel, Odyssey, or email. We have been very pleased with this scanner and software, both
                    with the quality of the scans and with the workflow efficiencies it offers. Support for the product by the vendor has also been very satisfactory."</p>
