<p class="block_text" id="BE4-0109">KIC Bookeye 4 is an indispensable tool for research, study and
production of enhanced quality reports and papers with crystal
clear color and black & white excerpts from books, magazines and
very large journals. In addition, as a UDSA compliant digitize-on-demand
system conveniently located among the stacks, KIC can
be used as an ad hoc digitization station by Interlibrary Loan departments.</p>

<p class="block_text" id="BE4-0110">With its 600 dpi option, KIC Bookeye 4
sytems are perfect as shared resources,
capturing the finest details for digital
archival and preservation.</p>

<p class="block_text" id="BE4-0111">The KIC Bookeye 4 can capture 20 book pages per minute for
instant access on tablets, notebooks, smart devices and easy
transfer to desktop PCs and servers. With a bed size more than
40% larger than its nearest competitor, Bookeye 4 is also the only
high resolution scanner in the world that supports both v-cradle and
flat modes, and can scan material as large as 24 x 17 inches.</p>

<p class="block_text" id="BE4-0112">Photocopiers, fax machines, PCs, monitors and keyboards clutter
up otherwise beautiful libraries across America. KIC Bookeye.4
reverses that trend, replacing copiers and fax machines and
adding scanning in a single machine with clean lines and efficient
design.</p>

there any compromises? You decide.</p>

<p class="block_text" id="CCM-0105">The KIC Click captures nearly 20 book pages per minute for
instant access on tablets, notebooks, smart devices and easy

KIC BookEdge self-serve scan and copy system!</h1>

<p class="block_text2" id="BE-0112">The days of the photo copier on the library floor are over. Students
demand digital, and your print collections are too valuable not to
make them available to the majority of college students today who
see copiers as "old school."</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="BE-0113">Occupying less space than a floor standing copier and offering
12x17 inch book-edge scanning, KIC BookEdge provides the next
best thing to face-up scanning in a form factor that's small enough
to fit in the far corners of any library! And its cost is small too.</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="BE-0114">But don't let its size fool you. KIC BookEdge systems provide the
same extensive capabilities as our heavy duty KIC systems: fast
scan/copy/fax/print, image editing and collating, save to tablets,
smart phones, notebook PCs, USB drives, and Cloud, send via
email or FTP.</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="BE-0115">What's so special about KIC systems is how easy they are to
use with their True2Touch interface and very large touch screens.
Students enjoy unlimited, fast and easy access to entire library
collections, <span class="bold">digitally</span>. It's not often that a service becomes so
popular with students so rapidly. It's fitting that KIC systems are
frequently purchased using student technology funds.</p>

<p class="block_text" id="BE4-0202">In the U.S. alone, KIC serves over four million students at the top "brick and mortar" (non-online) colleges and universities. With
the introduction of the KIC BookEdge, KIC Click, and KIC Click Mini, KIC is now affordable for virtually all institutions of higher
learning and full-service public libraries. Last decade, libraries typically 'added' several KICs, but since 2010 libraries have begun
to replace their entire patron-use copier fleets with self-serve book scanning systems.</p>

<h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0203">A True Digital Age Multifunction System for Academic & Public Libraries</h1>
<h2 id="BE4-0204">Book Scanning</h2>

<p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0205">Students at academic libraries want speed, and DLSG offers the fastest book
scanners on the market. Patrons at public libraries need simplicity, and KIC
provides three of the simplest possible user interfaces, one exclusively for
scanning, one exclusively for copying and one exclusively for faxing. And
KIC's best-of-breed power user interface is only a touch away.</p>

<h2 id="BE4-0206">Copier Replacement</h2>
<p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0207">While multifunction copiers are partly digital,
they are big mechanical machines with big</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0208">
maintenance issues and tiny touch screens. As a copier replacement, KIC eliminates copier
failure/service problems and provides very large touch screens and view screens that are larger
still. Organizing (collating, clipping, rotating, etc.) pages on a huge touch screen is much easier
than shuffling paper.</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0209">The digital age has steadily driven down the demand in libraries for paper copies to levels that
make it increasingly difficult to justify copiers. KIC self-service scanning systems reduce copier
use further - to the point that attaching a small laser or ink jet printer is sufficient. KIC</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0210">systems also handle much larger materials than copiers, and they
scan books without damaging them. However, the most
compelling benefit of KIC over copiers is KIC's speed, due
mainly to its face-up scanning design, which is not only
significantly faster, but far easier to use.</p>

<h2 id="BE4-0211">Self-Serve Fax</h2>
<p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0212">KIC's huge touch screen and larger view screen make faxing extra easy. Users can compose,
review, clip, crop and change brightness and contrast of the pages of a fax before sending. KIC's
step-by-step process is designed for easy operation by even the most timid users. All you need is
an internet connection, and DLSG will provide the rest at a cost so low that fax revenue can pay for
the KIC system in a few years or less.</p>

<h2 id="BE4-0213">KIC Coins</h2>
<p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0214">Printing copies and faxing have per page costs that normally
must be passed on to the user. KIC has a free, built-in method

<p class="block_text2" id="BE4-0215">Simply print wallet-size "KIC Coins"
on regular letter-sized paper in any denomination that you like, cut them

<h1 class="block-title2" id="BE-0401">KIC Bookeye vs. Copiers - How KIC Compares</h1>
<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0402">Copiers are Outmoded</h2>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0403">Since the first KIC was delivered to an academic library in 2004,
the days of photocopiers for patron use in academic libraries and
even public libraries were numbered. And now with the rapid ex-<br>
plosion of tablet computers and electronic readers, the demand
in academic libraries for electronic copies has substantially out-<br>
stripped the demand for printed copies. The demand for elec-<br>
tronic copies in public libraries is also reaching a tipping point.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0404">The ability to capture hundreds of pages of research into a tablet
or electronic reader and search through that material on the Inter-<br>
net with a tablet, eReader or notebook PC that can be used just
about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely valuable. In
this digital age, academic libraries are compelled to go hybrid for
three reasons: 1) the high demand for digital content; 2) their ex-<br>
isting print collections contain vast amounts of information that
cannot be found on the Internet; and 3) students are receptive to
the price of electronic copies - typically free.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0405">So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo
copiers? There are three main factors that keep the cost of photo-<br>
copies high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner and ink; 2) photo-</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0406">copiers require a lot of maintenance due
to the number of moving parts; and 3) all
major photocopier brands use a distributed
service model.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0407">In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC
because KIC has split the scan/copy
functions into three separate machines,
choosing the best of breed for each. As a
result, KIC offers the best book scanners
by themselves or with a loose-leaf paper
(ADF) scanner. Virtually any off-the-shelf
laser or inkjet printer can be added to any
KIC system, so you can optimize costs
and speeds, and offer affordable color.</p>

<p id="BE-0408">ADF attachment scans<br>
40 loose-leaf pages/min<br>
(20 sheets per minute)</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0409">Capture Area Comparison</h2>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0410">With a large 11.8 X 17 inch capture area, the KIC BookEdge system
has a maximum capture area that is 7% larger than large copiers
and more than twice the size of typical consumer scanners. The
image below shows the maximum scan areas of KIC products compared
to copiers and other book scanners.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0411">KIC Bookeye Scans 3 Times Faster</h2>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0412">Statistics from five million scanning sessions across America revealed
a median session length of 23 pages. So, most of the time
spent during a KIC session is spent scanning. Face up scanning
has been proven to be three times faster than face down scanning.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0413">KIC BookEdge Scanners vs. Copiers</h2>
<p class="block_text2" id="BE-0414">A Five Year Comparison at a<br>
Usage Rate of 50,000 pages per year</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0415">This graph compares the total costs of one color KIC BookEdge
system with a color copier and a black and white copier. Both
copiers are the kinds typically seen in academic libraries.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0416">The costs are broken into two main areas: equipment and
maintenance, and consumables. With KIC BookEdge, electronic
output is assumed to be preferred over print 90% of the
time. That ratio has ranged from 75-95% electronic in 2012, but
is certain to rise in the future.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0417">So why is speed so important?</p>

<ul class="peppermint" id="BE-0418">
 <li>It's economical. One KIC Bookeye can replace multiple copiers
or other face-down scanning machines.</li>
 <li>It gives patrons another reason to visit your library.</li>
 <li>It's green. The faster it is, the more use it will get and the less
the copier will be used.</li> 
</ul> 

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0419">In the digital world, there is no paper,
toner or ink, so libraries rarely charge for
images, whether black and white or color.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0420">Over the years, many libraries experimented with color copiers,
but could never find a formula that worked. If the fees were low,
patrons would copy materials with so much color that the library
would spend more on ink than the fees they were collecting. If the
fees were too high, the usage would be so low that the cost of the
machine couldn't be justified.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0421">KIC calculates the amount of color in an image before it is printed.
So the fee for copies with a little bit of color can be the same as
the fee for black and white copies. If a copy has a lot of color, the
fee can be increased in proportion to the cost of the color ink or
toner. This wonderful feature should be a simple, easy byproduct
of the digital age, and it is with KIC.</p>

<p class="block_text3" id="BE-0422">At a usage rate of 50,000 pages per year, these<br>
numbers represent a five-year savings of $36,358!</p>

<h2 id="BE4-0502">Face-Up Scanning is Faster!</h2>

<p class="block_text8" id="BE4-0503">KIC Bookeye 4 walk-up scanning stations are face-up scanners
that save a lot of time and reduce book spine damage because they
capture two face-up pages of a book with each scan and do not
require the user to flip the book twice for each page. KIC analyzes
each image, and automatically splits it into two separate images. 
In addition, black edges are automatically removed and the content
is straightened, producing clean, professional looking images
- important for electronic reserves, course curriculum materials
and research reports. These automatic image treatment functions
also save a lot of faculty, administrator, and student time.</p>

<h2 id="BE4-0505">Capture Area Comparison</h2>

<p class="block_text8" id="BE4-0506">The capture area of copiers is about half that of KIC Bookeye 4
while the capture area of typical consumer scanners is smaller
still. With a 18 X 24 inch capture area, Bookeye 4 captures it all!</p>

<p class="block_text9" id="BE4-0507">Face-up scanning is faster, easier,<br>

<p class="block_text12" id="BE4-0512">With its 600dpi option, Bookeye 4 is the only true preservation quality book scanner that's also ideal for self-service.</p>
<p class="block_text8" id="BE4-0513">To capture moving objects, digital cameras must use array CCDs,
which capture all parts of the object at the same instant. That's why
affordable digital cameras have fewer than 50 megapixels. And those
pixels must be further divided into red, green and blue sub-pixels.</p>
<p class="block_text8" id="BE4-0514">Since books don't move while being scanned, the Bookeye
4 is able to utilize linear CCD technology to produce ultra-clear images with astounding 140 megapixels. Each pixel
in a linear CCD includes full red, green and blue sub-pixels.
However, high resolution scanning is meaningless if the lens
system does not produce highly focused images. Since ultra-high resolution</p>
<p class="block_text8" id="BE4-0515">"spy satellite" lenses are quite
expensive, the Bookeye 4 scans from left to right, allowing
it to follow the curve of an open book and maintain
excellent focus, whether in V-mode or flat mode.</p>
<p class="block_text11" id="BE4-0516">The Bookeye 4's left-to-right scanning
allows it to follow the contours of virtu- ally
any book, producing better 600 dpi
images than other book scanners that
claim to produce 600 dpi images.</p>

<p class="block_text2" id="CCM-0503">KIC Click's Dual Cameras are Set at the Perfect Angles</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0504">Most books curve at the spine - some rather dramatically. KIC
Click gets deep into the bookfold of tightly-bound volumes
by capturing from two angles, and easily straightens out the
worst curves, producing clear, professional quality images.</p>

<h2 id="CCM-0505">Capture Area Comparison</h2>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0506">KIC Click's ample 16 X 22 inch capture area is over 50% larger
than that of 11x17 inch copiers and twice that of typical consumer
scanners. It handles a large percentage of books that are too big
for an 11x17 inch scan bed, scanning them two pages at a time
without damage to their spines.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0507">KIC Click's high speed is derived as much from its ultra-simple,
true two-touch interface as from its face-up design that obviates the
need to flip books over and over again during the capture process.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="CCM-0508">KIC Click's sleek look and elegant design put the full KIC self-serve
digitization functionality into a mere 25 inch width. Its large, 22
inch touch screen and capture surface are at the perfect heights
for quick, standing operation when placed on a typical table or its
optional K-legs.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE-0504">Compact & Affordable</h2>
<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0505">The KIC BookEdge is the perfect choice for student walk-up
scanning and copying in areas where space is a premium. It
makes entire library collections available in digital form. The
KIC BookEdge's clever design allows users to scan pages right
up to the bound margin near the spine, without damaging books.
The KIC BookEdge produces beautiful, full-color images at no
additional cost over black & white images! Even searchable PDF's
and text-to-audio (MP3 files) are a snap to create.</p>

<p class="block_text1" id="BE-0506">The KIC BookEdge was specifically designed to occupy the
same space as a typical floor-standing photocopier. Replacing
outmoded copiers in academic and research libraries is easy
with KIC BookEdge's modern scanning, printing and interactive
computerized touch screen technology. The optional ADF scanner
and a printer gives the KIC BookEdge the functionality of a color
copier at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<h1 class="block-title2" id="CCM-0612">Two Large Screens for Simplicity & Power</h1>

<p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0613">It's easy to undervalue screen size. For 20 years, all cell-
phone makers relentlessly pursued smaller and smaller
screens until very recently when one company reversed that
trend. They realized that people want the largest screen that
will fit in their pocket/purse and hand. This is because dis-
play screens are our window to the digital world, and touch
screens give us control over that world.</p>

<p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0614">As big as self-serve scanning systems are, it makes sense
to have a very large touch screen. And with the low prices
for high quality displays, it is compelling to add a separate
display screen. In 2002, DLSG realized this, when the first
KIC system was designed. Today, with nearly 10 years more
experience than any other vendor, DLSG has the most under-
standable, easy to use and powerful user interface for self-
serve book scanning, and it's based on dual screens.</p>

<p class="block_text3" id="CCM-0615">The view screen shows very large, clear images of what
you've scanned, allowing the touch screen to have big, easy
to understand buttons and other controls.</p>

<p class="block_text4" id="CCM-0616">Display screens are our portals into the
digital world, and touch screens are the
easiest way to control that world. That's
why DLSG provides large, 24 inch,<br>

screens with most of its KIC systems.</p>

<p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0704">Ease-of-use is a central feature of KIC. Its large, 22 inch touch screen and its large "Scan" and "Save, Send
or Print" buttons that occupy a very large portion of the touch screen clearly convey how easy KIC is to use.
The Save button defaults to an output method and file format that is selectable by the institution. If a flash
drive is inserted, KIC detects this and the output button changes to indicate that it will save to the flash drive.
Users can override the default output method by manually selecting one or more other methods of output.

<p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0705">KIC Bookeye 4's high speed is derived as much from its ultra-simple,
true two-touch interface as from its face-up design that obviates the
need to flip books over and over again during the capture process.</p>

the full-size KIC. It has its own tabletop version of the SmartDock, and
of course, an ADF scanner can be placed anywhere on the table. ADA
compliance is achieved by purchasing a table with a 30 inch clearance to
the floor and a 31 inch height.</p>

<p class="block_text16" id="BE4-0707">KIC Bookeye 4's elegant design puts the full KIC self-serve
digitization functionality into a compact and appealing space.

<h1 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0801">KIC Bookeye vs. Copiers - How KIC Compares</h1>
<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0802">Copiers are Outmoded</h2>

<p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0803">Since the first KIC was delivered to an academic library in 2004, the
days of photocopiers for patron use in academic libraries and even
public libraries were numbered. And now with the rapid explosion of
tablet computers and electronic readers, the demand in academic
libraries for electronic copies has substantially outstripped the de- mand
for printed copies. The demand for electronic copies in public
libraries is also reaching a tipping point.</p>

<p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0804">The ability to capture virtually unlimited numbers of pages of re- search
into a tablet or electronic reader and search through that ma- terial
on the Internet with a tablet, eReader or notebook PC that can
be used just about anywhere is highly convenient and immensely
valuable. In this digital age, academic libraries are compelled to go
hybrid for three reasons: 1) the high demand for digital content; 2)
their existing print collections contain vast amounts of information
that cannot be found on the Internet; and 3) students are receptive
to the price of electronic copies - typically free.</p>

<p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0805">So how do the costs of KIC systems compare with those of photo
copiers? There are three main factors that keep the cost of photo- 
copies high: 1) each copy requires paper, toner and ink; 2) photo-</p>

<p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0806">copiers require a lot of maintenance due
to the number of moving parts; and 3) all
major photocopier brands use a distributed
service model.</p>

<p class="block_text18" id="BE4-0807">In contrast, these costs are lower for KIC
because KIC has split the scan/copy
functions into three separate machines,
choosing the best of breed for each. As a
result, KIC offers the best book scanners
by themselves or with a loose-leaf paper
(ADF) scanner. Virtually any off-the-shelf
laser or inkjet printer can be added to any
KIC system, so you can optimize costs
and speeds, and offer affordable color.</p>

<p id="BE4-0808">ADF attachment scans<br>
40 loose-leaf pages/min<br>
(20 sheets per minute)</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0809">KIC Bookeye 4 Scanners vs. Copiers</h2>

<p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0810">This graph compares the total costs of one color KIC Bookeye
4 system with three color copiers and with three black and white
copiers. Both copiers are the kinds typically seen in academic
libraries. One KIC Bookeye 4 is compared with three copiers
because its face-up operation yields well over two times the perfor-</p>

<p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0811">mance of a typical copier. The costs
are broken into three main areas: equipment
and maintenance, consumables, and
patron usage time. With KIC, electronic
output is assumed to be preferred over
print 90% of the time. That ratio has ranged
from 75-95% electronic in 2012, but is certain
to rise in the future.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0812">No More Book Spine Damage!</h2>

<p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0813">Thick books with stiff spines and content that runs deep into
the bookfold are often damaged when copied. KIC Bookeye
4 easily captures content without damaging book spines.</p>

<p class="block_text20" id="BE4-0814">KIC automatically removes black<br>
edges, straightens content,<br>
and produces clean, pro-<br>
fessional looking images<br>
- important for elec-<br>
tronic reserves, course<br>
curriculum materials<br>
and research reports.<br>
These automatic image<br>
treatment functions also<br>
save a lot of administrator,<br>
faculty, and student time.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0815">Thick Books...No Problem</h2>

<p class="block_text21" id="BE4-0816">KIC Bookeye 4 handles thick books beautifully. Its contour-<br>finding
laser allows it to flatten even the most curved books<br>
and produce text that is clear and undistorted. KIC automati-<br>cally
adds margins for print-ready image quality.</p>

<h2 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0817">KIC Bookeye Scans 3 Times Faster</h2>

<p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0818">Statistics from five million scanning sessions across America revealed
a median session length of 23 pages. So, most of the time
spent during a KIC session is spent scanning. Face up scanning
has been proven to be three times faster than face down scanning.</p>

<p class="block_text19" id="BE4-0819">So why is speed so important?</p>

<ul class="peppermint" id="BE4-0820">
 <li>It's economical. One KIC Bookeye can replace multiple copiers
or other face-down scanning machines.</li>
 <li>It gives patrons another reason to visit your library.</li>
 <li>It's green. The faster it is, the more use it will get and the less
the copier will be used.</li> 
</ul> 

<p class="block_text22" id="BE4-0821">In the digital world, there is no paper,
toner or ink, so libraries rarely charge for
images, whether black and white or color.</p>

<p class="block_text22" id="BE4-0822">Over the years, many libraries experimented with color copiers,
but could never find a formula that worked. If the fees were low,
patrons would copy materials with so much color that the library
would spend more on ink than the fees they were collecting. If the
fees were too high, the usage would be so low that the cost of the
machine couldn't be justified.</p>

<p class="block_text22" id="BE4-0823">KIC calculates the amount of color in an image before it is printed.
So the fee for copies with a little bit of color can be the same as
the fee for black and white copies. If a copy has a lot of color, the
fee can be increased in proportion to the cost of the color ink or
toner. This wonderful feature should be a simple, easy byproduct
of the digital age, and it is with KIC.</p>

<h3 class="block-title2" id="BE4-0902">Faster is also Easier</h3>

<p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0903">Face-up book scanning is far easier on both patrons and
books and quite a bit faster than face-down scanning.</p>

<p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0904">Scanning books face-up makes it much easier to keep track
of what pages you've scanned. With KIC Bookeye 4 and
other face-up scanners, books stay face up, so you can see
what you're scanning as you scan it. This extra visibility elim- inates
the age old problem of skipping pages and scanning
pages out of order which can occur with face-down scanners.</p>

<p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0905">The following photo sequences show the reason that facedown
scanning systems are typically 1/3 the speed of faceup
systems. The book flipping necessary to scan a book
on a face-down scanner like the KIC BookEdge is shown in
the photo sequence below. It's a workout both for the book
and the patron.</p>

<p class="block_text23" id="BE4-0906">The ergonomic design of the face-up scanning sytems
involves only the basic movement required to set a book
down and turn a page.</p>
